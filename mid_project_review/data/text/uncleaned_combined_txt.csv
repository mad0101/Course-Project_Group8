"My life is finally getting calm after yearsI just reconnected on reddit and i feel the need to make this post. 

I'm just so peacefull in my life, last summer i posted about suicide and my chronic depression was at the lowest and honestly had the idea of trying to kms and serious plan and opportunity to do it. My life before was a whole valley of trauma,  i never had the luck to being born in a happy family, system who failed to protect me, doctor and teacher who always pretended to see nothing about bullying or domestic violence. 

My love life was also an hell, when u never learn how to love and grew up for surviving u become the perfect victim for every kind, broken abusive kid like you or other who don't have any reason to be ah other than it was easy to abuse you and they won't remember about ur name or being shocked by the consequences their actions provoked. Therapist failed me for good, i hate meds cuz they put me in when i was younger and i had a serious past of od and addiction to shit like valium and xanax. 

Now i just feel like i finally can take a breath, i finally had the strongness to escape an abusive relationship i was trapped in, to take time for myself during month's and i never collapsed again. 

It's been almost 5 month's since i met my bf, we live together, we wanna adopt a rabbit or a kitten together. It's just so calm, i do my stuff, we sometime lay on each others but we just choose to break the cycle, now i restart my life slowly, finish to do my paper and i will restart my studies in the domain i love ! (makeup and hairdress) 

I always did what my parents wanted in terms of studies and as a result I had to stop high school because of burn out and since then I don't have my highschool diploma and I can't set foot in a school without having a panic attack, so all of this is surely ridiculous in the eyes of the world, but it makes me happy to do it at my own pace for me, to see myself, the child I left in my childhood room who was crying silently and hoping that she wouldn't die tonight. 

&#x200B;

I am saving her little by little, I am sad about the past but I have a lot of hope for the future, I am doing my best, the bagel of dissociations that is my life is filling up little by little.

"As someone who normally struggles socially, today I learned that I do have something valuable to contribute and maybe I’m even more likeable than I thought (!!!)I (30F) had to wear a large, very visible medical device all through high school. I was in an orchestra that required auditions and I was in marching band as a FLAG GIRL (I was the *SECTION LEADER* lol), I was in drama club, had braces and uncontrolled asthma, big frizzy curls, and took only AP and honors classes… I was basically Lisa Zemo from Ned’s Declassified School Survival guide but with headgear, acne, and a World of Warcraft addiction. I was asked on one date in high school.. by a boy who felt bad for making fun of my headgear. I kissed a boy once when I was 12 (before the device) but never again til my device was off when I was 19.

I eventually grew up and got a degree in statistics. As a woman in STEM, I was constantly looked over and talked over in group settings so I just got used to viewing my input and ideas as invaluable and even bothersome. During that time, I put myself through college, bought my first car, *and* moved out of my parents’ house earning money mostly off of my looks after blossoming around age 22 (promotional modeling, Gogo dancing, etc) until I was 29, when I got my current job. Yes, I started college late. Now I have a career based on academics alone, which is more my speed.

But as we all know, when you grow up funny-looking, you always feel like that little weird kid inside. I have always felt like an annoying, socially-inept nerd due to existing solely online during my formative years. I’m 30 now and I am medicated for social anxiety due to that, but I still really struggle socially, especially opening up to people.

Yesterday I shared about a free, local quantum physics lecture event coming up soon that’s open to the public… in a staff-wide email at my job. It felt risky! I wanted to throw up! My hands were sweating when I sent it! I fully expected people to think I basically sent spam mail and everyone was going to think I’m bothersome and annoying.

BUT

Instead, I got several emails back thanking me for sharing, some saying it sounded cool (!!!), and a few said they might even go!!!!!!! A coworker I’ve never met even went out of their way to come introduce themselves to me and thank me for sending out the event details!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It might seem small but it feels incredible knowing that what I genuinely expected (the worst case) didn’t happen, and I know my therapist is going to be so proud of me when I tell her about this later today. I called my mom about it and she said she’s proud and it made her day. It makes me feel like maybe I am actually likeable and it’s given my confidence a little boost. Maybe I’m not as weird and annoying as I thought.

And I’m so proud of myself for getting over that fear for long enough to share something that can bring other people joy.",0

Being with her and just the fact of being with her is mind blowing. I’m literally jealous of myself…

Saying I’m happy is saying nothing. I’m more than happy… even more than I ever dreamt of. I appreciate every moment with and don’t take any second spent with her for granted.

I wish everyone happiness and lots of love in their lives. Stay healthy and enjoy all that can be enjoyed. Love is indeed all that is always there no matter what’s happening in the world.

I just met an amazing person a week before my birthday and we clicked on so many things. I have a realistic outlook on life but this feels so dream-like. She even expresses herself similar to me and I feel I'm talking to someone sent to help my day better.

I know I was lonely for a long time but I never became toxic because of it. A huge amount of people spiral into negativity and end up lonely.
They will refuse to believe that they deserve love which will become self fulfilling.

"If You Aren’t As Happy as You Would Like To Be, Consume ArtIf you are unhappy or not as happy as you would like, consume more art. 

Citizens who consume art tend to be happier than those who don't. [A study of more than 20,000](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332097023_Does_Art_Make_Us_Happy) adults found those who went to the theater, concerts and read often reported more positive well-being. Researchers from the Institute of Social Sciences Ivo Pilar recruited 4,000 Croatians to test a similar hypothesis. [They found a positive correlation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-010-9724-2) between subjective well-being and time spent on leisure activities such as going to art exhibitions. Medical researcher [Grossi also identified the link ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265139702_Cultural_Participation_Relational_Goods_and_Individual_Subjective_Well-Being_Some_Empirical_Evidence)among Italians who consumed music, literature, and art.

Art can improve your subjective well-being by influencing how you feel. *The Blind Side* is a movie about Michael Oher, a homeless Afro-American kid who eventually becomes a first-round NFL draft pick. For non-American football watchers like me, let me explain. Drafts allow teams to recruit players throughout the rounds, as few as seven and as many as thirty. A team picking Michael in the first round meant they found him so valuable they couldn't risk losing him. This story is bound to elicit positive emotions in almost anyone because we can[ place ourselves in the fictional story.](https://nicolasforero.substack.com/p/you-should-probably-watch-more-netflix) We can feel the protagonist's thankfulness, respect, and courage. ""He deserved that,"" we all think.

*Quick note: You might be thinking, who are you, and why should I listen to you? I'm a social scientist, author of In the Arms of Morpheus, a human behavior newsletter.* *Pleasure to meet you :)*

There's a chance plays, movies, and artwork won't make you feel emotional easily. It's common among ""cold"" people, those who don't often bring their emotions to the forefront or who lack the vocabulary to voice the emotions they feel. As a ""cold"" person, I can tell you that art can still improve your well-being. 

Art can make your brain simulate how you would act in complex situations you haven't lived without paying the cost of living them. In[ You Should Probably Watch More Netflix](https://nicolasforero.substack.com/p/you-should-probably-watch-more-netflix), I wrote:

""You don't know how you will react to discovering your partner cheats on you until it happens. And I can't think of anyone who would like to experience that to know what it feels like. Watching or reading a fictional story of someone dealing with a cheater is a better alternative. ""

You open the space to think about how you would react to situations you might live in the future when you watch a fictional play, movie, or painting about those events. It is not guaranteed. But, often, the decision you come up with will have more benefits or fewer costs than the one you would have made without thinking. 

Let's say being cold is not the problem, but not liking art, or at least the art forms you can access. Art will improve your well-being even then because it can raise your status. Galas, art shows, and operas often host prestigious people. People who are more likely to change your career or life in the least amount of time or know someone who can. One conversation is all you need to outweigh the annoyance of yawning. With time, you might develop a taste for art and squish every drop of benefit.

Sometimes, your social status won't change, but the group itself will improve your subjective well-being. 

I'm part of a writing community called Foster. In 2023, twenty-five writers and I flew to Puerto Escondido for a four-day retreat. In it, I met people who fit the ideal of a friend I'd built over the years. My anxiety about meeting people like them was so pronounced that I spent five weeks in Mexico in 2022 because I felt I had more chances to meet them there. In close to 24 years of living, I hadn't found these people. So it does not sound irrational to believe it could've taken me more years if I hadn't participated in Foster. But I found them. And, thanks to that, I've been feeling more positive emotions than I've felt in months.

Now, if people who consume art are more likely to be happier, shouldn't most artists be happy? Or at least happier than the average population?

While I didn't find scientific data backing the idea that artists are unhappier, many artists I've met seem unhappier than others.

Of course, this could be an illusion. 

My experience and conventional wisdom tell me artists tend to be more attuned to their emotions and less ashamed of sharing them than people in other fields. How they feel about themselves and the world inspires them to create. Without emotions, few ideas would come, if any. There would be nothing to express. So when artists create, for example, poignant artwork, it isn't because they are in despair. But because they have the emotional serenity to discuss these events without affecting their feelings. 

If this is true, I can see how those who work as artists aren't unhappy, on average. But how the kind of people who want to become artists have inner challenges already and seek art to solve them. Their ""negative"" art is, thus, not proof of art affecting their well-being but of their need to express these emotions somewhere to heal. So the benefits of art are still there.[ Higher relaxation](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421656.2016.1166832),[ reduced anxiety](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.4276/030802213X13603244419077), and increased well-being. It's just that the average artist trying to enjoy them has gone through more than the average person. 

What I can see as a cause of unhappiness, though, is artists' average incomes. Architecture, design, and production are artistic paths that lead to an above-average income. But dancers, entertainers, actors, photographers, and musicians earn [less than other fields. ](https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/Artists-in-the-Workforce-Selected-Demographic-Characteristics-Prior-to-COVID%E2%80%9019.pdf)Fine arts, art directors, and animators earn, on average, $50,505 annually. More than the US median of $48,305 but below the average in business-oriented creative fields such as marketing, branding, and creative direction. 

As a result, many artists live in below-average rent, food, and safety conditions that affect their well-being. How ""bad"" these conditions can make them feel depends on how good or bad their social circle is doing. Studies have found that absolute income doesn't have a significant effect on life satisfaction. But[ relative income does](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797610362671?journalCode=pssa). Suppose an artist earning 30,000 a year hangs out with others earning the same. In that case, he might not obsess over his below-average living conditions. But dissatisfaction will likely come if everyone around them makes 200,000 a year.

Those ""sad"" artists you meet, assuming they are ""sad"" and not just attuned to their emotions, might be because of their past and living conditions. Not because art is not improving their well-being.

**So it's worth asking, how can you benefit from art?**

The obvious question is to ""do"" more art. Go to more museums, knit, and learn to play an instrument.

This is a valid suggestion, but there is a caveat. For art to bring the benefits we have described, you must be engaged in the activity. Quality of life researcher[ Alex Michalos found](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225498000_Impact_of_Arts-Related_Activities_on_the_Perceived_Quality_of_Life) weekly time spent on any of sixty-six art-related activities didn't predict happiness. But how engaged people were in the activities did. You won't know if you will like a particular creative activity, though. So benefiting from art might be a matter of jumping between artistic activities until you find the one you like and then building a habit of doing it.

""If you hear a voice within you say 'you cannot paint,' then by all means paint, and that voice will be silenced,"" said Vincent van Gogh. The most unfortunate thing that can happen is spending a few hours on an activity you don't like. The most pleasing is that you will have a method to be happy for the rest of your life.

**I'd love to hear about your experience with art. Do you consume or produce it often? What's motivating you to do so?**",0

I’m 16 and started an engineering internship that my teacher recommended me for (I’m the only one in all of the pre-eng classes to get this opportunity, which is crazy to even think that he chose me of all people). 

Anyways, been going at it for 2 weeks and it’s been pretty good. Really nice people, bit boring at times, but it’s speeding up now that I’m getting the designs and processes down. I’m allowed to wear whatever I want and am allowed to listen to music which is pretty nice. Small company so I get to see all the processes. Not gonna talk about what exactly they do but goddamn it is so cool sometimes. Got my first check today, about $220, which isn’t a ton, but it’s a start and I’m happy. 

Just overall, a great first job and I’m genuinely pretty excited about my future for the first time in awhile.",0

"Finally! A happy ending after almost four decades of being lonely? You decide!Who says that good people don't exist anymore?  Thanks to someone I confided in on good ol' Reddit, and the maze of emotions I was trying to find a way through, she slapped some sense into me!  Long story short:  I just got married for the first time at the ripe young age of 60 (she's 55)!  I've had a successful career but was just too scared to get close to anyone.  It's a long story, and if you want details, well, you can read the whole sad story in my comments history.  Whether it was fate, luck, or some kind of conspiracy, the sister of my long-dead girlfriend came into my life.  She broke through the emotional walls I had built up over 3 decades and showed me that I am capable of loving without reservation.  Did that come out cheesy?  Ah, who cares? 

Anyway, she's never traveled outside the US so I told her we'd go anywhere in the world she wanted.  She made a list and we're going to cross off every single place!  We were in Hawaii a few days ago and just seeing her in the sunset, I knew I couldn't live without her.  So, I asked her to marry me, she said yes!  We are honeymooning in Japan at the time I'm writing this!  Pardon my rambling, but she makes me feel like I'm a teenager again and I'm looking forward to actually living again instead of merely existing.

Reddit and Redditors out there, you've given me an outlet for my frustrations, a place to tell the stories I've accumulated, and the opportunity to make a few friends along the way!  But it's time that we slow down.  I just want to let you know that it's not you, it's me, lol!

Wish me well on my new journey (or roast me, I don't care which, lol!).  I'm going back to my warm and no-longer empty bed!",0

I'd be honest about the prices of the rent and let people know they're paying for the maintenance workers and other security etc yknow. I'd probably live off of a few hundred $ rather than millions of $ cause like... why do i need to hoard all this money.

So the design of the apartment will involve:
Each floor contains some rooms linked together by corridors.
Each room has a big bed with a TV or whatever.
Each room has a balcony with a garden of flowers and you'd be able to walk around your little garden every morning and enjoy sunrise.
Each room comes with a voice controlled machine that talks to you and reminds you of things or it can suggest you stuff or even take care of the kids while you're away by asking them ""what cartoons do you want to watch?"" N changing the TV channels.

This is an apartment I'd like.",0

I've been talking a lot to someone on Instagram and they just understand and accept me for who I am. I have always been the weird kid or the outcast or the person into stuff no one finds interesting for as long as I can remember. Because of that, I became very emotionally withdrawn and believed that emotions were weak. 

A few months ago I did the Myers Brigg and it told me I was INFJ and I thought it was wrong cause Emotions are weak and I'm not emotional and so on. But time went on and I noticed just how true it was! 

So anyway we talked and I just felt comfortable with them and it was like therapy; they listened and replied and it just made sense. They were so caring that I told them that I had to do something important and started crying; Not tears of sadness but of joy! I haven't smiled or felt so happy like that in a long time. It was so alien that I thought something was wrong for a moment.

My lungs hadn't had the chance to fully develop, so I was on a respirator for 2 1/2 months-- and I had laser-eye surgery around that same time for something called ROP (Retinopathy of Prematurity). The laser surgery prevented me from going blind, but up until about 8 months ago, I still had to wear glasses with a very strong prescription. (As mentioned in a few interviews recently, I had a life-changing eye surgery back in April/May of last year, that gave me 20/20 vision for the first time ever!)  And that's just the tip of the iceberg!  Long story short: I overcame a lot in my first few years and was a little fighter! So to me, this song is a representation of everything I've been through. 

Hope this song and video makes you smile! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7zCsCkuhto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7zCsCkuhto)",0
"I'm so happy I've cried like 3 times in an hourThis post was removed from casualcoversation but it took me a while to write because emotions and I just want to share it so I hope it's allowed here...

Not sure if this is the right place for this but whatever I'm too happy to care and just want to rant for a second. Over a year ago I lost my left arm and a few fingertips. My left arm was terribly scarred, misshapen and just overall I hated the look and feel of it so much. I literally did not once leave the house without covering it up. Maybe 10 people saw it other than medical staff. 

I just removed the outer layer of the bandage for the first time to change it and oh my goodness. It's so much better looking. Like I can't believe it. The scars are not anything what it looked like the first time and I think they will actually heal. There isn't much arm left and sure I still have only one arm no matter what but I feel so much better about my body already and I'm only 2 days post surgery. I feel like I actually might be excited for summertime this year! Just feels nice to be optimistic about my body again!!",0

"Had an awesome birthday yesterday!!11!!!1!!!!!1I hung out with 3 of my closest friends and we went to dinner at the restaurant I work as a cook at. My parents paid for the meal! My boss brought out a dish he made for us and wished me happy birthday. My friends and I finished our meal and then afterwards, my coworkers had bought me a cake and they gave it to me! It was really nice, I almost cried lol. I also got a silly Build A Bear I wanted from my mom. Didn't do anything else that day except hang out more with friends after dinner and then I got a good sleep. Lots of people wished me happy birthday and ultimately I had a good day. Happy 19th to me :3",0

"I Changed My Life for the Better, and You Can Too!Hey Reddit,

I wanted to share a personal story that I hope will inspire and motivate others to take control of their lives and make positive changes. A few years ago, I was in a really dark place. I was unhappy with my job, my relationships, and most importantly, myself. I felt like I was just going through the motions of life and wasn't living up to my full potential.

But I knew deep down that I wanted more for myself, and I decided to take action. I started small, setting achievable goals for myself each day, like going for a walk or reading a book. As I began to accomplish these goals, my confidence and self-esteem began to grow. I also started to surround myself with positive, supportive people who encouraged me to pursue my passions and dreams.

Eventually, I made some big changes in my life, like leaving my unfulfilling job and pursuing a career that I was truly passionate about. It wasn't easy, and there were definitely some bumps along the way, but I'm now living a life that I'm proud of and excited about.

I want to encourage anyone who's feeling stuck or unfulfilled to take the first step towards changing their life. You don't have to make big changes all at once, but every small step counts. Whether it's starting a new hobby, reaching out to old friends, or even just making your bed in the morning, every small action can lead to big changes.

I hope that my story can inspire others to take control of their lives and make positive changes, just like I did. Let's all support each other on this journey and remember that we're all capable of achieving great things.

Thanks for reading, and I'm excited to see what positive changes you all will make in your lives!

Warmly,

Thesexmaster_",0

"I had such positive customer service informations todayI had three of the most positive customer service interactions I've had in a long time. 

The first was a woman at Victoria secret who had such a positive attitude, and I felt like she wanted to have the interaction with me. 

The second was another women at hobby lobby who had previously checked out my items, so I showed her the previous finished project, and told her about the next one. 

And the last woman was at Starbucks and had a nice smile and asked what my plans were for the day, and listened and responded with more questions. 

I feel like I run into so many customer service people who are so clearly only there for the paycheck, that today was a much needed breath of fresh air",0

"The best of joys from the worst of difficultiesOnce upon a time, there was a man who struggled with a lot of difficulties whenever he went to the toilet. He often felt frustrated and defeated, and he found it hard to feel happy or positive about anything related to the bathroom.

One day, while he was in the middle of a particularly difficult experience, he heard a strange noise coming from outside the bathroom window. Curious, he peeked out and was surprised to see an old clown hopping around on the sidewalk below.

The clown was singing a delightful song of nonsense words, and his energy was infectious. The man found himself smiling despite himself, and he felt a sense of joy that he had not experienced in a long time.

The clown noticed the man looking out the window and waved cheerfully, inviting him to come outside and join in the fun. At first, the man was hesitant, but the clown's enthusiasm was contagious. He took a deep breath, gathered his courage, and stepped outside to join the clown.

Together, they hopped and danced to the rhythm of the clown's silly song, and the man felt his spirits lifted. For the first time in a long time, he felt truly happy, and he forgot all about his bathroom troubles.

As the sun set, the man said goodbye to the old clown, feeling grateful for the unexpected interruption that had brought him such joy. From that day on, he made a point to seek out moments of joy and happiness wherever he could find them, and he remembered the kindness of the old clown every time he went to the bathroom.

In the end, the man realized that happiness could be found even in the most unexpected places, and that life was too short to waste on worries and troubles. He learned to cherish the moments of joy and laughter that came his way, and he was forever grateful to the old clown who had helped him find his way back to happiness.",0

I think I just made Valentine’s Day better for some peopleToday at my college they had an engagement fair for the clubs and I went to every table and looked at the info for all the clubs and even signed up for a few since it’s my last semester at my college. The building was also decorated for Valentine’s Day and I thought of being cynical and write one to myself saying “Really buddy? Alone again.” But as I walked up the stairs I got the idea to make valentines for people. I made around 8 or so on heart shaped paper. I handed them out to some girls. I went back upstairs to make more. I asked the lady at the desk if she had any more heart shaped papers I could use and she gave me a stack of them. I wrote “Happy Valentine’s Day!” On all of them. I handed those out to more girls. I went back upstairs and made 20 more valentines that were just on construction paper. I handed those out to more girls in the building. The reactions of the girls on my campus were great and seeing them smile as I gave them something for Valentine’s Day made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. I know this is small but I also know I made Valentine’s Day better for them. I’m happy I didn’t write myself a stupid letter making fun of myself.,0
"I am flourished by the swollen heart of a kind-hearted stranger.Today, and the last three days were a total wreckage. My girlfriend (?) told me she has lost love for me and wants to end the relationship for good. I went to work bawling my eyes out while many of my coworkers were nice enough to comfort me. Though I do live with her and our two kids, I thought I might not end Valentines day on a negative note, so I naturally went to the store to buy an inexpensive vase of flowers and a beautiful balloon. I arrived at the checkout with expectations the total would be what I could afford and it was twice the amount. I told the cashier Ill return it and as she was about to take it, this kind-hearted stranger behind me offered to help buy it. I told her it wasn't necessary but I had a strange feeling just to just say okay. I thanked her with a million thanks of appreciation and left feeling joyful. Nobody what happens next, I'll know miracles and incredible people still do exist.",0

"In a world of crazy families I’m blessed to have my brotherMy life is crazy. My husband’s family never does favors for free (I get it) and even then, they won’t do any favors that would inconvenience them in any way (also understandable). My husband’s car broke down so we had to carpool in mine to work. He both work an hour away from home, right down the street from each other. His family all live within 5 min from our house. The problem with carpooling is that he works 7-4, i work 9-6. Our baby needs to be picked up from the sitter’s at 5:30 at the latest.

So i called my brother who lives 20 minutes away from my house, an hour + 20 min away from my work. I asked him if he could pick me up from work and take me home, so my husband and i could carpool in the morning and my husband can drive my car home after work to pick up the baby on time. He didn’t even hesitate to say “okay, what time do you need me there?” I paused and told him “it’s far though…i can pay you gas money or whatever an Uber would cost.” He told me “not necessary, just let me know what time you need me there and I’ll be there.” 

When i was younger my mom always said that my brother was a “gift” for me. I never really saw it that way as a kid, but now that we’re grown… there’s nothing my parents have ever given me that i cherish more than my brother.",0

Well tonight I asked for a massage tonight and he was surprisingly really good and took his time, which I complimented. He said thanks I watched some videos of how to give hand massages!

So sweet.",0

"My trip to Japan is happening in 5 days!!!!!!!!!!I'm so excited I can't contain myself and I just need to tell everyone about it. This trip is a replacement for a reward which is a trip to UK I got from an essay writing + video presentation making competition I won in 2019 and has been rescheduled over and over due to many reasons. In the end we've come to the conclusion that I can choose to go anywhere and I chose Japan because so many of my special interests are there. I'm autistic and being surrounded by my interests feels like heaven. I'm going to an amusement park, an aquarium, museums, shopping areas for stationery and animanga merch and I will be sending mail (postcards) while I'm there. I will also be going alone which is super exciting because it will be my first time travelling alone, I've always wanted to do it. I'm just excited right now.

"I stopped being a people pleaser and started living my lifeI've grown up planning the life that ""I wanted"", but in a way that would also make my parents proud of me. Good big university, respectable major, married, buy a house, and have kids young. I have anxiety and always stressed out about doing things perfectly, and I eventually realized how annoying I was about showing off my accomplishments to my parents. I ended up going to a community college and spending 4 years on a 2-year English (switched to Library) degree, though I did get married and bought a house young, but I couldn't ""get"" my husband to want to have kids yet... At 22-23 years old. It may not seem like the perfect life of milestones like I wanted growing up, but it all ended up working out really well for me. 

As a fresh 24-year-old, I finally learned to ignore our parents' incessant pleas for grandbabies (I do want them, just not right now) and to stop worrying about everyone else's success and downfalls around me (my past subconscious: because if they're doing better I won't be special and if they're ""failing"" then I'm still the golden child). It has hurt to recognize these negative and quite toxic mentalities I've had, but now I've discovered who I am beyond my own and everyone's successes and downfalls, and now I am way happier living life the way I want to!",0

I pushed through it and have been feeling better. Today I helped one of my best friends with her homework assignments she had really been struggling with, after a couple of hours we finished the assignment and she thanked me. When I was coming home from school I thought about that moment and it made me remember one time when I was struggling with my mental health, a really good friend         of mine had helped me in the same way, which gave me the realization of how far I've come these past three years and i am very proud of myself.",0
"Just started dating this girl that I met a few weeks ago and I REALLY like herSo about two weeks I met this girl though online dating and since we started talking we went on two dates. The first date was alright, but our second date was outright amazing and we both came out of that date super happy about the experience and about each other.

We scheduled to meet again soon, and we keep texting each other in the mean time... Here's the thing... I am super super into her, like, more into her than I think I have ever liked anyone else. This is super early into our relationship, I know, I mean we still barely know each other, but from the little I do know about her I honestly think I might truly love her.

A little more than a year ago, I broke up with my ex-gf who I was together with for a year before that. Despite me breaking up with her, I had a lot of fun and enjoyable life experiences with her during our time together, and ever since we broke up I met a few more girls here and then, but we never had the same connection like I did with my ex, and they never appealed to me like my ex did.

For the first time, this girl I'm seeing right now, I like her more than I did my ex or anyone else, I think she could be the one. I keep saying this hesitatingly because it's still super early and we have much to learn about each other, but I am really hopeful we could build an amazing long-term relationship together.

She still doesn't have my reddit username, but I can just imagine that eventually I'll show her my Reddit profile and she'll see this post where I talk about how amazing she is. :)

We'll have to see, only time will tell.",0

"My mother said she believes I ""don't want her as my mom"". She was right and now I have real mother.I don't have a great relationship with my mother. I know my mom did the best she could but she had an awful childhood and I do not think she was emotionally and mentally equipped to be a mother. I am not going to get into everything but I feel emotionally underdeveloped because of it. She was verbally, emotionally and on a few occasions even physically abusive. 

However my future mother in law is amazing. She is perfect in every way she is kind, caring, loving, warm, understanding, and motherly. I absolutely adore her. I call her mom and she calls me son. I wish she was the women that raised me but am so thankful she is in my life now and is one of the biggest parts of my life. 

She is perfect and her daughter (my fiancée) is perfect as well. I feel like I won the lottery of life and really don't know what I did to deserve such happiness. I can't wait for our wedding wedding in a few months because I will have an amazing wife and a wonderful mother.

I was depressed and suicidal for 9 years before I went through therapy and luckily happen to meet them a few weeks after starting therapy. I think both really helped me. I never thought I would make it past my early 20s but here I am 6 years later and my life is amazing all thanks to these 2 wonderful women.",0

I am happy and i am okay with where I am in life. Things will get better and I need to focus on what I want, my loves once and the life I want to have. It’s okay if you are not where you thought you would be, you are here ! You made it, like have throw you shit but you overcome it. ! Be prude of you! 

Happy day beautiful people!",0

"I got an 8week old Akita Inu puppy and have had her for a week, it's been the happiest time of my entire lifeI (20F) and my partner adopted an 8 week old American Akita Inu puppy. I've only been with her a week, and she can be kinda rough and frustrating, but I've never been so sure or happy in my entire life.

I've been stuck in a long cycle of being down on my luck, having issues with relationships and severe depression. My heartache started last February when I had to let go of my cats for a deathly allergic roomate and had them rehomed to my absolute dismay. My mother stopped talking to me and my entire relationships and financial stability in ruin.

And three weeks ago, I had an abortion I regretted (and still do) greatly that hurt me very bad, as I felt I had lost something that I couldn't fathom not being able to love, but had to let go because I and my partner were not in the place or able to take care of it. This specifically destroyed me and I had almost taken my life because it was too much to handle with the guilt I felt

But then I got Yumemi (my puppy) and I've never been so in love. Not only did things look up for me with getting her, but this adorable little girl literally saved me from myself. The love I have for her is immense and the week, almost two come tomorrow, had been the happiest things have ever been for me, and the way my life so positively turned around getting her makes it all the better.

I'd do anything for this puppy, which means I'm going to push on, and grow with her. Sorry if this was ranty or edgy, but here's a photo of Yumemi (right) with my roommates Chihuahua, Concha (left) and some more photos (including her first walkies and my fave picture of her first pup cup)",0

"Wanting to share how happy I am about my relationshipI see so many negative posts on reddit about people's relationships! I'm so happy to share how great mine is instead!! 

We met on tinder somehow, first date went great and the rest is history over 3 years later. 
I've never felt so comfortable with anyone. I have so many odd quirks, so many weird things I can't do or don't like. Yet I'm so comfortable being open about my weirdness and have someone who tries to accept and compromise with me on the things I can't or don't want to do. Someone who has given me such a solid foundation to a relationship. No lying, nothing suspicious. Just love, trust, respect, and consistency. 

He helps me take care of my grandparents, he supports me through school and a career change while he was going through his own, does the tedious daily tasks (like cooking and cleaning) that I sometimes don't have the patience or energy for. Takes care of me when I need it but also knows I'm independent. His friends are amazing and he easily gets along with mine. Hes also handsome as can be and exactly my type 😉 How could I be any happier! 

He realizes things he can work on for both himself and our relationship. Prioritizing mental and physical health as well as trying to be better at communicating (which we both are working on)

I never used to want to have a serious relationship, get married, or live with anyone. Now we've been living together for a while and I wouldn't have it any other way. We've been talking about long term, and I'm excited about everything we have in store for our future, from a possible engagement to finding our dream home. So many things to look forward to with this man, and I just want to scream it from the rooftops 🥰 but it's cold outside, so I'll tell reddit instead!",0

"I've always wanted to donate blood in memory of my grandma (reasons below) but I've always been too scared and nervous. I overcame my fears today and donated for the first time!My maternal grandmother sadly died when giving birth to my mother in the 60's. She lived in a very, very rural area in Ireland, and they unfortunately didn't have enough of the right blood for a transfusion in time. 

I've always wanted to donate blood because of this but I have an irrational fear of needles and I was worried I'd be a bit squeamish (yes, I am a wimp).  

Anyway, fast forward to my 30th birthday and I vowed to book an appointment to donate. I chickened out and rescheduled twice but today was the day! 

I massively overthought the whole thing - I found it really straightforward and enjoyed my free biscuits and a chat with the nurses at the end (who doesn't love a custard cream?!). 

So today I'm really happy for overcoming my fears and for honouring my grandma in my own way, which I've never had the courage to do before. 

Thanks for listening!",0
"I have had some recent revelations about myself that I need to share with someoneTLTR: I completed all my childhood dreams and it blows my mind

When I was a child I had some strange goals for myself that I completely forgot about until recently. And I seem to have achieved many of those goals despite myself. I wanted to study Animal Behaviour and Folklore in University- and I did. I wanted to know semiprecious stones well enough that I could recognize many of them- and I can. I also wanted a collection of pretty rocks- I have one. I wanted to know the names of different wild plants and trees- and I do, at least for the Boreal Biome. I have struggled with self loathing for most of my life- and I realized the version of me I hated no longer exists. I’m not that person. Maybe that person never really existed in the first place. I wanted a romantic partner who loves me for me. Who I don’t have to try and be someone I’m not when I’m with them. Who understands and appreciates the same things I do. This dream felt impossible, that such a person could not exist. But they do, and I am so grateful to have them in my life. Not only would I kill or die for them, but more importantly, I would live for them. I will force myself to keep moving forward no matter what, one step at a time, simply for the honour of knowing them.",0

I don’t really care about relationships and girls at the moment, which I feel like is a good thing for me, because while most people my age are so focused on getting a girlfriend or boyfriend I’m over here enjoying my life and focusing on my studies.

"I’m so overwhelmed by the simple kindness of my friendsIn 2021 I heavily struggled with loneliness and self worth issues, I only had one friend and it was very codependent and just made me feel even more alone. 

Going into 2022 I made a real effort to change things. Started going to therapy, working on appreciating myself more and getting out of my comfort zone by going to social events and meeting new people. And it’s really paid off in ways I’m still discovering. And now it’s 2023 and I have a fairly sizeable network of friends and acquaintances around me and it still feels alien to me sometimes to have people that want to support and be around me with no ulterior motives. 

I was sick today and had to go home early, missing my last two lectures of the day. And my friend in one of my lectures texted me asking how I was feeling, sent a list of everything covered in the lecture I missed and offered to pick me up medicine or snacks while she was in town. This was all unprompted and it just. Really hit me. This is what it’s like to have healthy friendships with kind people. 

I never thought I’d be here, being so overwhelmed (and honestly crying a little) by simple kindness from the people in my life but I’m so grateful everyday and I love all of them so much. If anyone reading is suffering from loneliness or feeling like their friends don’t appreciate them, it gets better and you will always find people who love you for no other reason than they just want to.",0

"I’ve never felt so secure in a relationship before. My current boyfriend makes me so happy. (Happy rant)Don’t mind me. I just need to type this all out.

Me and my boyfriend got together not too long ago, but I’ve never felt so genuinely content in a relationship. Unlike with others I’ve been in, I don’t feel the need to rush anything or say things I’m not comfortable with. 

He has never crossed any boundaries and always makes sure I’m comfortable with whatever he’s doing that’s a bit out of the norm. 

When we were just friends I used to lie on him while we watched movies and every single time I thanked him for letting be close, he’d reply with, “No problem! Anything to make you more comfortable” and it made my heart soar.
It still does.

He makes me feel so good about myself, whether it’s just randomly calling me pretty or practically fanboying over my art. He never fails to make me smile and laugh.

He’s the first notification I check for in the morning and no matter what time or day it is, I’m always looking forward to hanging out with him.

I have my moments where sometimes I’ll feel left out or insecure but whenever I tell him he makes sure that it won’t happen again. I’ve had nights where I’d be positive I’d be going to sleep sad but he changes everything. He makes me smile so easily.

Even when other people are around, he has no problem letting me touch him or saying affectionate things and it’s just… He’s just so sweet. I’m very happy with life right now.",0

I am asking because I (27F) virgin who has lived a very stressful life most of my life, with not much life experiences..
spent most of my life at home, with almost no social life studying all day.. and only had 2 six months relationships.. my mom always told me to wait till marriage to do anything that I want to do, such as travelling with my partner, sleepovers etc.. this made me very lonely over time as most people wasn’t living that life still and didn’t want to date me.. or even befriend me as I had a different mindset 

I am still studying and living with my mom.. and doesn’t have the freedom and money to do what I truly want.. like going out to parties, activities with friends etc.. 

I am naturally extroverted but I’ve been living a very introverted life for as far as I know.. this left me with mental health issues, no friends..

I haven’t lived the life that I wanted to live at all and has been so unhappy for the past 13 years.. I am finally graduating this semester.. and I met a gentleman (28M) a year ago who asked me to be his girlfriend about a month ago.. 

We’ve been together for 2 weeks and yesterday he expressed his desire to have kids in 1 year.. while I feel like I would need at least 5 years.. only because my body probably wouldn’t allow me to wait for 10 years.

He also would like to marry me first of course. But I am so tired from studying, switching careers and all that I do not mentally feel ready for kids at all. I want some time for my self and for us.. to rest, live life, find happiness, and better prepare to have kids.. before bringing them to the world.

If I have kids anytime soon, I feel like they will prevent me from finally living my life.. as they will constantly need me. And the fact that I never truly been happy in life makes me scared that I won’t know how to make them happy.

My partner on the other claims that he is always happy and has much more life experiences than me.. travelled around and had great life experiences with his friends and previous partners and lived his life much more than I did. Maybe that’s why he feels ready today.

Am I exaggerating? Are my worries valid?

Recently said ""I love you"" to them (I've said it before in the context of ""I love you, you came to get food with me so I wasn't lonely/scared in a crowded space"" or ""I love you, you helped with homework"") usually in a semi-joking-but-I-actually-do-love-you sorta way, but I've been sick for the past few weeks and sort of out of it and I've missed them, and I told them that I loved them (they were being super frickin' sweet and patient with me and I just- JAJDNF I don't deserve them-), and they were caught off-guard by it initially, but said it back, and we now say it sort of on the regular and it just makes me do happy stimmy leg kickies because they are genuinely the person I love most in this world and it makes me so happy that they love me too :))",0

"Reasons Why You’re Feeling Restless and Unmotivated 

Being restless means you feel the need to constantly move, can’t calm your mind, or both. It can also come with hyperactivity, anxiety, palpitations, agitation, or not being able to sleep(**insomnia**).

Being restless means being unmotivated and having trouble focusing on or completing tasks. For example, when you’re restless you may find yourself unable to focus on anything for very long and find yourself unable to get anything done. Other times, being restless means feeling anxious or nervous without knowing why. For example, you may feel restless and anxious when you’re at home, but when you’re at work you feel perfectly fine.

Sometimes people feel restless when they’re unmotivated. When you don’t feel like doing anything, you’re often said to be “too restless to sit still.” This isn’t the same thing as feeling anxious instead, it’s a kind of low energy and a lack of motivation. Sometimes people use the word “restless” to describe being unable to relax or unable to stop moving.

## 12 Common Reasons for Feeling Restless And Unmotivated :

#### 1-You Don’t Have a Clear Goal:

It is hard to stay motivated when you don’t have a clear goal. It would be helpful to have a goal that you could see yourself achieving. Once you have this goal in mind, you will be more motivated to work towards it. If you don’t have a clear target, it becomes much more difficult to stay on track and push yourself. Having a good aim will help keep your motivation strong, as well as see the progress you’re making towards your goal.  
To increase your likelihood of success, set small goals that are both manageable and challenging.

2-Pursuing many goals at once:

People who say that we can achieve anything we want in our lives do not mean that we can achieve all things simultaneously. If we have multiple goals, we need to achieve them one at a time. Working on too many things simultaneously can lead to feelings of restlessness and dissatisfaction. It is important to choose your goals wisely and to avoid multitasking if possible. Doing things one at a time will lead to greater success.

#### 3-Not Getting Enough Sleep:

Not getting enough sleep can make you feel restless and unmotivated. Make sure you get enough sleep each night so you can feel more energetic and motivated during the day. When you don’t get enough sleep, you’ll be tired during the day, you won’t be able to focus, and you won’t want to do anything...[**Read More**](https://viemina.com/12-reasons-why-youre-feeling-restless-and-unmotivated/)",0

"Personal Win: Landed a new job after dyslexia held me back in interviews.I was made redundant a few months ago as part of the big tech layoffs. I work as a Senior Software Developer. I have what’s been described during my diagnosis as ‘severe dyslexia’ (also have dyspraxia)

I’ve been interviewing for months but my dyslexia has been really holding me back. I was finding in interviews that either: my mind would just blank completely, I would really struggle to articulate my points and process things really slowly. In interviews I would just fluff technical tests because I would struggle to read the questions or my brain just wouldn’t articulate the point.

As you can guess my confidence was non existent. I had an interview yesterday and the employer actually went out there way to accommodate my dyslexia. They sent me questions ahead of time, allowed me to use a screen reader and even gave me so much time to process the information.

"Embrace Change in Your Life with simple and easy ways Whether it’s something big or small, change is a part of life. The best thing you can do is embrace change and learn how to deal with it.

In the face of change, sometimes the best thing to do is to change nothing. Other times, the best thing to do is to change everything. The choice is yours. The only constant in life changes and the only thing that can be changed is what you choose to focus on.

Change is inevitable. One minute you may be living in a difficult moment and the next you may be living a happy one. Remember that everything is constantly changing. Change is inevitable in any field, but that doesn’t mean it has to be a bad thing. Learning from your mistakes, as well as your successes, is crucial for growth and improvement. Embracing change and making it work for you can be the key to happiness and success in your life and your career.

**15 Ways to Embrace Change in Your Life :**

**1-Identifying change :**

If the change impacts you negatively, do not run from or attempt to hide the discomfort. Instead, name the change. The ability to identify the emotions elicited by a change can help you to accept the change more quickly. If you find yourself feeling stressed, frustrated, or anxious, take a moment to consider what is causing those emotions. Acknowledging the discomfort will allow you to understand what parts of the situation you can control and what parts you cannot.

**2-Remember that change is necessary and ordinary:**

It can be difficult to accept that change is simply a part of life. However, if you can keep this in mind, it may help you to better deal with change, especially if you are currently facing an uncertain transition. Keep in mind that change is often necessary, and this can help change your mindset.

**3-Look at the situation optimistically:**

It can be difficult to see how change might positively impact your life; usually, people default to considering the negative consequences first. But there’s no use dwelling on the negative try thinking about the opposite instead. When facing a change, it can be helpful to make a list of all the potential benefits. This can help you to stay positive and focused on the potential outcomes. The people around you may also benefit from the change, so it is worth considering how they will be affected. Whenever you need motivation, refer back to a list of the positive changes, both short and long-term, that this will bring about in your life.

**4-Keep a diary:**

It is useful to take notes about your thoughts, reactions, purposes, and dreams when you start your journey. Writing in a diary once a day or once a week will help you see your story. This will help you deconstruct, reinvigorate, and love your life.

**5-Preparation:**

The goal of the preparation stage is to get yourself ready for the change. This means doing the mental work and planning so that you can take the steps needed to make the change you want. By the end of this phase, you will truly believe in your ability to change.

**6- Visualize the change in your mind**...[Read More](https://viemina.com/how-to-embrace-change-in-your-life/)",0

"How to boost your mood with simple and easy ways  Having a bad day? Feeling down? We all have those days. Life is unpredictable and it can be hard to stay positive. It’s normal to experience low moods or feel overwhelmed with day-to-day tasks. In these uncertain times, it can be difficult to find joy and peace. The constant worries and anxieties of everyday life can leave us feeling exhausted and overwhelmed. But, it is important to remember that our mental and physical health are connected and that being in a good mood can help us stay healthy and optimistic. Fortunately, there are a few simple steps we can take to boost our mood and cultivate more joy in our lives:

## 1-Get up early:

When setting your alarm, aim for 15 minutes before your usual wake-up time. You'll be able to plan your day better and be more productive with this extra time. Allowing yourself this extra 15 minutes in the morning can make a huge difference in how your day progresses.

## 2-Go outside:

Even though it sounds simple, being outside in the fresh air may make all the difference. Our bodies were not made to sit in front of fluorescent lights all day. You'll feel more at peace if you get some fresh air. Taking some time to enjoy nature and step away from the stresses of everyday [life](https://youtu.be/S6ntQQ68c54) can have a significant positive effect on both our mental and physical health. Whether it's a walk in the park or a hike up a mountain, immersing yourself in nature can do wonders for the soul.

## 3-Workout:

It's likely that you've heard that exercise releases endorphins, which provide the familiar and cherished emotion of happiness. Yes, it is true! Turning your day around might be as simple as going for a walk or a run, or working out with weights to release stress. Not only does physical activity produce endorphins, but it can also help alleviate symptoms of depression, reduce stress, and increase self-confidence.

## 4-SMILE:

It may seem far-fetched, but research suggests that forcing a smile triggers an increase in positive emotions, as the muscles used in a genuine smile release endorphins that interact with the brain to make you feel good. So smile and laugh. it's easy.

## 5-Treat yourself:

What do you find enjoyable? Is it a book? a tasty hot beverage? Chocolate? To escape that rut, reward yourself from time to time. After all, there's nothing wrong with taking a break and rewarding yourself after hard work.

## 6-Pet your animal:

Take a moment to pet your pet, whether it's a dog, cat, or some kind of bird—whatever pet you chose to have. You feel happier and less stressed after petting an animal. After all, what's there to be upset about when your pet is beaming at you?

## 7-Give a hug:

It is scientifically proven that hugging someone we love for a few seconds makes us feel happier, safer, and more cherished. all of that in under a minute! (But be sure the person you're hugging wants to be held, or you might be in trouble.) This simple act of physical contact can have an enormous impact on a person's mental state, reducing stress, calming the nerves, and providing a sense of security and comfort.

## 8-Take a nap:

Taking a nap might sound counterintuitive when you're in need of a mood boost, but according to a study from the National Sleep Foundation, it can actually be beneficial. It's because a nap gives your body and mind the opportunity to rest and rejuvenate, which can help reduce stress levels, improve your mood, and increase your energy. It's important to keep the length of your nap in check, though, as too much sleep may leave you feeling groggy and sluggish. That's why it's important to choose the right length for your afternoon siesta—a quick 20-minute nap should be just right for a mood boost!

## 9-Have some mood-boosting foods:

Eating certain foods can help boost your mood and make your day a bit brighter. Whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats are all important nutrients to add to your diet to help with mood regulation. Foods like dark chocolate and walnuts are especially helpful in releasing endorphins, which can make you feel good.

## 10-Drink more water :

Making sure to drink plenty of water can also help you stay hydrated and energized throughout the day, further contributing to your mood.

## 11-Put on your favorite dress:

Wearing something that you feel comfortable and confident in can bring about a feeling of happiness and even help boost your productivity. Wearing some of your favorite clothes will instantly lift your spirits and make you feel more prepared for the day, even if you spend the entire day at home.

## 12-Keep up with hobbies:

Occupying oneself with a hobby is a really beneficial way to remain content and motivated. A hobby may be the honing of a skill, a craft, or simply an enjoyable pastime that enables one to relax and take a break.

## 13-Get More Sleep:

When one is tired, they are not themselves, and partial sleep deprivation can have a huge impact on one's mood. Sleep is essential to lead a healthy and successful life.

## 14-Have a quick tidy-up:

Make sure to reserve some time, even if it’s just for five minutes each day, to tidy your environment as it will be beneficial for your mental health.

## 15-Try a new routine...[Read More](https://viemina.com/25-simple-ways-to-boost-your-mood/)",0

I work as an environmental engineer and one of our big issues is that optimizing stormwater models takes a really long time. We've hired an outside firm to help because they've automated the process, but they're really annoying. I have decided to render them obsolete by building my own tool.

Some people at work know I'm working on this, but they don't know that I'm trying to get it done BEFORE the outside firm finishes their work on our project.

I'm probably going to lose because their tool already existed when I got the idea to build mine, but I'm still having fun with it :)

And if I win ... Oooooooh that would be such a nice victory!",0
"Am finally at peace and am so happy with lifeI'm a teenager who spent an entire summer working 40 hour weeks in construction which was very difficult (and even gave me PTSD for my alarm for waking up a 5:00 AM lmao). I was tired of having my GT 1030 PC which was struggling to run games made past the mid 2010s which was extremely frustrating for playing new games with my friends. Alas,  at the end of the summer I had saved up $2000 dollars and bought all the parts for my pc. I build it and nothing. No signs of life at all. Did some diagnosing and thought I had found the reason why it wouldn't work. A defective part. Was so certain of the issue that I returned the part I ordered and got a replacement. Still wouldn't work. I was so certain I did it AGAIN! STILL WOULDN'T WORK. Was so mad that I gave up and for about a month was very down. I sacrificed hours of good times with friends for something that didn't work? I thought about it everyday and thought that I had just wasted a summer in one of the best times of a human life due to no responsibilities and less accountability. Don't want to sound cheesy but I genuinely felt depressed. Eventually I started to forget and over time it started to matter less as in school I was doing good. Great friends, the highest grades I'd had in my life so far, and enjoying life in general. However as Christmas came around, there was one thing I wanted. To fix my computer and put that chapter behind me and be able to move on. My dad offered to help and a couple days after Christmas we took it to a repair shop. I don't know what the issue was, and frankly I don't care as I have finally moved on from this difficult part of my life as the PC is working and I am currently typing this from it. These past few weeks have been on the same level or better than the days before covid. I really hope that later in life when I'm, going through a rough time I can look back on this post and think that there might be a light at the end of the tunnel :)",0

"Things aren't the easiest for me. But even when it gets tough, this is why I believe life is worth itSo, to give you a little bit of a background:
I have some great things going for me: I was born with a fully functioning body (besides allergies) and to two amazing parents who, although they both have mental health challenges, love me. I had access to public education as a kid. And I'm really smart (not a genius though, but pretty close) 

But other things were tough right from the get go: I have autism for one. I couldn't enunciate enough to be coherent until I was about eight (I still struggle with being heard right to this day). At that point,  I was diagnosed bipolar because I tried to kill myself. I believe part of this was due to trauma that happened when I was four. Regardless, my brain had stopped regulating emotions and, from that point, I was either trying to rule the world (with full confidence that I could) or trying to avoid humanity and sleep until I passed away. I was still forced to go to school where, although I received top marks without caring, I refused to conform and became the target of my peers and sometimes my teachers wrath(this would continue until I graduated.)

After that I was repeatedly hospitalized for being a danger to myself, or not being able to take care of myself. (16 times) 

BUT here's the good part:
Life is good! Things are still hard, my meds don't help 100% and I'm struggling with housing, but even when I'm down, I love life! It's the little things that truly count. A leaf from a tree, dipping your fingers in a stream, finishing an art project, a smile from a stranger,  or having just enough money for Starbucks hot chocolate and being able to tip the change. You might ask why do all these things make me rich if they have no measurable value? Why does this make up for the hard things?  Because I chose to give them value.  When we are grateful, we give value to the things which the universe has given to us, and that makes us all the richer. Maybe the key to happiness isn't getting more, but placing more value in the good things which we do have. 

Going forward, I want to fall in love (and get married). I want to hike from Mexico to Canada, and am planning on doing this on the CDT with my mom in a few years. I want to adopt a kitten and see it through its whole life. I want to experience as much as I can of what the earth has to offer me. I have hope that I can find a little thing everyday, and that makes me happy.",0

But today I finally felt happy and proud of myself because a few days ago I actually asked out the girl I like to prom, now she did say no but she was really nice about it and said that she would love to but is going with friends instead.

"My coworkers nearly made me cry with a surprise.Today’s my birthday. I worked a shift yesterday but have my actual birthday off.  I mentioned my birthday in passing to my coworkers but didn’t think much of it just because I try not to expect much for my birthday. It just ends in disappointment when people (especially friends) forget it, ya know? Like a decent amount of my birthdays have been for the past few years. 

Now just a lil backstory: i’m only a few months into this job and I love all of my coworkers dearly. I love working at my workplace because I genuinely love every single person I work with. I talk with them a ton, and we all just generally have a good time. They’re all so kind and thoughtful and interesting and I love them all. 

Near the end of my shift one of my coworkers called me into the back and I was confused. My manager came up to me and said “someone told us about a little something.” 

A lot of people started gathering and they hit the lights and started singing happy birthday as they lit a candle and handed me some cake. 

It took so much effort for me not to cry. 

I’ve never been in a community where it felt like people gave so much of a shit about me. I really can’t describe how grateful I am for my coworkers and managers.

today i ordered a lyft to get me from the airport to a gas station to buy some cigs and on the way i chatted up the driver along the way. to my amazement, i offered 25 in cashapp to get me 3 packs(since i dont have my ID) and a ride back and he did it with such kindness. he even offered to book me a hotel for the night to save me having to stay at the airport.

i got his contact info and let him know id probably take him up on his offer. something about the whole experience left me all giddy and smiling. its just good to see good people doing good things for others. even if it seems too small to matter or too big of a nuisance, to the one needing the help it could mean the whole world.

"Misdiagnosed, not actually really mentally ill or physically ill, I am perfectly healthyWhen I was in high school, I was diagnosed with like 11 mental illnesses and my family had come to terms with the fact that I’d never function like a regular human being. I had a shitty immune system, extreme irritation, self-harm, paranoia, occasional hallucinations, etc. And my parents were considering supporting me for the rest of my life and not sending me off to post-secondary. Thankfully, my school advisor heavily pushed for it and said to give it a go, since my grades made the bare minimum for acceptance. 

After moving out for university, however, I landed my ass in a very chilly apartment. It was really fucking cold, so I had to bring a bunch of extra blankets. The weight was oddly comforting and helped me sleep. Within a week, just about every mental issue plaguing me was gone, and afterward I realized I hadn’t been seriously sick for an entire year. When I went back home to visit though, some of my symptoms came back. Anyways, I realized most of my symptoms were chalked up to sleep deprivation because my parents’ house is too hot. After they turned down the thermostat I was back to normal. 

I’ve been sleep deprived for 17 years and everyone thought it was mental illness. I’m so happy that I’ve been “cured”. I’ve gained an appetite for the first time, my skin is clear and not scabby, and my mind feels so clear. My physical health is getting better too, as I’m no longer as sickly and put on healthy weight. I’m ecstatic and feel amazing, and have been acing my exams without any special accommodations.

Looking back, I think my first inkling that this wasn’t a mental illness was that I was like a different person on vacations, when I got to stay in a heavily air conditioned hotel room all day and got proper sleep. But as I got older and struggled more with school, I couldn’t afford to go on vacations anymore. Better late than never though, I’m just thankful that everything is sorted.",0

It was a niche book series that’s kinda hard to find and she’d even noticed which volumes I already had from stories I posted about them so she could get me the next in the series. 

I don’t know, it’s just a level of care I didn’t expect and I feel so… considered? I’m so happy! She also gave me a card that referenced the tv show that started our friendship, I just feel so valued it’s wonderful.",0

"I Looked in the Mirror Today and I Don't Hate the Way I LookIdk where to post this, please let me know if this is the wrong sub

I've always hated the way my body looked.  I fluctuated between feeling too fat and too skinny (5'9, 123 lbs).   I hated my thighs, hated my boobs, hated my hip dips, everything.  Hated having a ""flat ass""

Today I looked in the mirror and saw no flat ass but a bubble butt.  I liked the way my boobs looked.  I saw my ribs (nothing too unhealthy, I could kind of see my ribs, which is something I go for and am comfortable with).  My thighs were moderate, no thigh gap but not too thick.  No stretch marks either from constant weight gain and loss(high metabolism).  For once I like my body.  

That is all i had to share.  Thank you.",0

He makes me laugh. He loves the same music I do, and even some I wouldn’t have expected him to know. I admire him. Everything I learn about him makes me appreciate him even more. He takes time to call me even with his extremely (!) busy schedule. He’s concerned with my health and makes sure to ask how I am considering he himself is recovering from a much more serious condition. I love how he protects his siblings, how close he is with his nephews. I love how he tells me about his day, from the most mundane things to work-related issues. I love how he  goes to church every sunday. I love how he belts out while driving. I respect how straight he is with me, no BS just because he’s still technically courting me. I love how he thinks courtship shouldn’t end once the relationship begins. I love how generous he is with people who are less blessed. I love how he makes me feel special and cared for. He makes me happy. I’m blown away by how smart & responsible & sweet he is, and I’m so looking forward to learning more about this amazing man.

I want to tell him in person. Then I’m gonna give him a tight hug and a kiss that will have him questioning what’s left and what’s right. As soon as I’m 100% covid free, I will.",0

Yesterday, 12/01 I officially got diagnosed.

""you *name* are not crazy, you just have an illness and we can work and grow now that we know"".

This moment, yesterday, is the best thing that happend to me so far this year. I'm growing.

"I got to the Advanced class in rollerskating!!I have been doing rollerskating classes for some 3 years (not counting the quarentine), from those I spent 2 years in the entrance-level classes and 1 on Intermediate.
In ~October, when I asked my teachers about when they tought I would go to Advanced, I tought they said until the end of the next year. So I was NOT expecting it AT ALL when they called us at the end of the class in december, and gave us the papers to go to Advanced. 
My sister, my friend and I passed!! yaaas
Also Advanced usually gets the coolest choreographies and the best costumes at the presentation at the end of the year, and they do 3 numbers instead  of 2!!!

"my dog is finally acting like himself againMy dog is a rescue and easily spooked. He’s been with me for 1 1/2 years now and well settled, but a few weeks back something spooked him at home and ever since, he changed - suddenly tended to make himself smaller, avoiding contact he usually seeks and took to sleeping in the living room instead of the bedroom (even though that’s his favourite place). I gave him both love and time, as not to overwhelm him or disrespect his boundaries and tried to eliminate the source of his discomfort. Today he choose to cuddle with me in the bedroom for the first time in weeks and you can see the change in him. He’s already way livelier, playful and almost back to his usual self. I am just so happy to see him enjoying everything again!",0

Also looks like we are going to be able to afford to go on holiday together for the first time in the near 4 years we’ve been together! 
I spent the last 4-5 months of the 2022 in tears and riddled with anxiety due to the cost of living crisis in the UK (as well with the stress of Christmas!) but I managed to spoil both my partner and step kid. Saving is going well. Anxiety has settled a bit more. Feeling like working 2 jobs is finally paying off.
Just feeling happy and thankful.

"I started talking to someone on Reddit and it changed my life. I've never been this happy, Reddit. Thank you.Obligatory on mobile, English is not my first language, etc.


So a while ago I [28F] started talking to someone [27M] via Reddit chat. We immediately hit it off and had a lot of fun talking to eachother, with deep and long conversations. We told eachother real personal stuff though, things you don't easily tell people in real life. It's Reddit so it's all anonymous and we're never going to meet.


I'm from a tiny ass country in Europe (Netherlands) where Reddit isn't super popular, so you don't often meet people that are on Reddit (although it's increasing) or even know about it. I felt completely safe sharing all this personal stuff with a stranger, because he was just that, a stranger. It might've turned kinda flirty at some point. No harm in that right? It's all anonymous.


After talking for a while he said something regarding the weather at his location, which was stunningly similar to mine. The realisation kinda dawned on me, so I asked where he was based. Lo and behold, he told me he was from the Netherlands. I sat there looking at my screen for a good bit. I couldn't believe it. How big is that chance?


We'd been communicating solely in English at that point, as one does on Reddit. So I asked him which area, which turned out to be the same as mine. We live 30 minutes apart. My job is close to his house. So, I answered him in Dutch and let him know just how close to me that was.


After getting over the initial shock, we kept on talking and eventually exchanged numbers. Both deciding to lose the anonymity, we started to get to know eachother, kept on talking for hours and hours on end. So, after deciding he was thrust worthy, and he probably deciding the same for me, we decided to meet up.


A lot of tension had been building at that point, but we also already knew things about the other that we'd only told our best friends, or in some cases no one. That's a real different starting point then one normally has when going on a first date.


Well, Reddit, it was amazing. We had so much fun, sparks were flying everywhere and it also turned out we have the same interests, some of the same hobbies, we ran in the same circles and, while our paths were wildly different, are now in the exact same phase in life. 


Over time, we started to figure out we also want the same things in life, have quite the same outlook on life and what we want life to be like, and we really can talk to eachother about anything. He's also smart, kind, insanely funny, considerate, caring, loving and also he's very, very hot. 


I felt super safe and comfortable with him from the start, and I not only started developing feelings, I was falling madly in love with this man who ticked off every single box, whom I met through f*cking Reddit, of all places. Who's going to believe that? 


I somehow never doubted he felt the same. I was looking for a catch, something wrong, but somehow everything felt and was right, even more so when we were together. We spoke about our feelings, with the added bonus of knowing things about eachother that not many people knew. 


And then, Reddit, he called me his girlfriend for the first time, and it was the best feeling in the world. A bit after that, I almost blurted out ""I love you"", but caught myself just in time. I thought about it, and realised I felt it, meant it. But, I also knew about his past and while I'm not going into that, at that moment I didn't want to put too much pressure on him.


So I waited, and almost blurted it out a couple times more. I knew this was some sort of russian roulette, which could only end up with me blurting out ""I LOVE YOU"" at a very inopportune moment. 
Reddit, I'm here to tell you that after a couple of days, HE told ME first. Oh, the pure and utter happiness I felt in that moment, I'm still relishing in it. So I told him I love him back, and the love we shared in that moment has to be what life is all about.


Right now, we're building the deepest connection I've ever build, and also having a connection that's so deep, so intense, that I've never had with anyone else. It feels like I'm right where I'm supposed to be, and I love him so, so much.


So I've got to thank you Reddit. Not only for being my source of entertainment, advice, lessons, laughs, tears, frustration, sadness, outrage, happiness, cute animals, funny animals, and everything in between. But also for changing my life in the most meaningful way, and having me meet my amazing boyfriend (I mean really, what are the chances? I tried to look it up, and there's like a 1 in 1500 chance someone is from the Netherlands, but there's so little data that I have no idea what the chances then are they're from the same area as us, so yeah). 


Truly, from the bottom of my heart, thank you.",0

"My fiancé is the best human I’ve ever metI just need a place to let out my feelings.

My fiancé is the best person I’ve ever met. I’m on my period. He has refilled my hot water bottle about 6 times in the last few hours. The second it becomes lukewarm he takes it and refreshes it. And then he came into the bathroom and asked if he could dispose of any period products for me and would I like a cup of tea.

I cried because a dog I love on the internet died. He held me so tight and told me it was going to be ok, to be happy for how he lived and the impact he had on the world. Then asked me if I wanted anything to eat or drink.

This man has been my rock for 6 years and I am so lucky and bursting with emotions.

"A post about my friend Celia. She is a special type of person the likes of which I doubt I’ll meet again.A post about my friend Celia

She doesn’t use Reddit she will never see this but I just wanted to write some stuff about my friend Celia. She and I became friends due to me learning her language in my own country and becoming ‘penpals’ with her. This continued and eventually we met on an exchange visit. Since then (5 years ago now) we’ve gotten closer and closer and now I’m living in her country for a year to further my studies and I get to see her a lot more. 

We have so many common goals and interests as well as a lot of differences too and we’ve spent the majority of our friendship being apart and not even necessarily in regular contact however I know she is there and she knows I am too. It’s really great. 

I don’t know how to explain it and maybe someone else can relate but she’s the kind of friend that makes me feel so unbelievably happy and fuzzy and warm the majority of the time. It feels like the closest possible thing you can get to true love on the platonic side of things. 

Thank you Celia te quiero x",0

"You will never truly be happy without this...If you ask people what they want out of life the most common answer that you will get is to be Happy. Simple right?

But chasing happiness is an illusion...and in the world today where we are surrounded by all these forms of instant gratification that give us a short term hit of pleasure and satisfaction people have been fooled to believe that this is what it means to be happy

In reality this is nothing more than a false sense of happiness, because true happiness is like anything in this world worth of value: MUST BE EARNED!

We as humans are built to solve problems and need obstacles and resistance to overcome and grow in order to reach our peak potential in life.

This is where the real feeling of happiness resides...so with that said, prioritize your purpose and Focus on Fulfillment...chasing pleasures and fun will only leave you empty at the end of the day.

"Person I’m crushing on said I have golden retriever energy yesterday 😊I have a friend, met her a while back. she’s always mentioning how her husband has golden retriever energy. I have never heard that compliment before and since then I always wished a girl I was into would say the same about me because I feel like her husband and I share a lot of idealisms but I never wanted to force such a compliment, so I never told anybody about this desire.
Cut to now, I’ve been talking with this new girl nonstop for the last few weeks and she randomly complimented me saying she really loves my golden retriever energy.
My face turned so happy and my grin was smiling nonstop. 

I’m sooo happy hahaha ☺️☺️🥲😭 I will catch a grenade for her 😭😭. I protect. 

Just wanted to share this happy moment 😊. She said she’s a black cat personality so idk what that means for us two being fully completely compatible. But she’s not stopping my heavy flirting attempts. My friend says she kinda flirting back a little",0

"ive been accepted to the college of my choice and as of 2 days ago ive been 6 months clean!!!tw for some talk of suicide at the end, but it happy! I don't want to die anymore!! 

I haven't been able to talk about it a whole lot with my friends because I know that it'll make them sad, all of my friends are juniors and it's a couple of states away, so I'll rarely get to see them, but I'm finally getting away from my bad household!!! I've been dreaming of this day for like 4 years- I'm finally getting out from a large part of their thumb!!!! I'm so happy- I've cried over it a couple of times,, I was considering staying closer, but things have been getting so bad with friend groups- so I've decided to go out of state!!! I'll finally be able to live how I want to live, I'll be able to have my own schedule, I won't be berated everyday, I'm finally getting some actual freedom in my life, even if it comes with other responsibilities- I'll finally get some fucking control!!!! and it's one of the colleges of my choice!!! they have everything that I want to focus on!!! they have a good forensic program, which is what I'm hoping to study, they have a good theatre program and have some good choirs, plus a good entomology program which I might minor in!!!! I'm just- so relieved-

and also, as of 2 days ago, I've finally been clean for 6 months of self harm!!! I've made a lot of improvements to myself that I'm really proud of!!! it's been a little over 4 years since I started and I got kind of addicted to it in early 2021, so it's been tough getting here, I've only been able to get here twice since I started, and now that I'm here for the third time, I'm not terrified that I'm going to relapse!!! it's, such a weird feeling,,, I know logically that I might relapse again, but the fact that I don't think it's going to happen soon really means so much to me- it's like I've finally gotten to a point where I can actually see the progress I've been struggling to make for years- I'm really proud of myself for that!! I've been able to develop so many new coping mechanisms, and I've been through so many shitty things and relationships, I think I'm actually going to make it to college!!!!!! for the longest time, maybe mid middle school, I've had the deep feeling that I'd never make it to college, whether I'd fail out or I'd kill myself before then, I finally think I can make it there! I can finnaly, actually see a future for myself!!! I don't have to think that I'll die before then!!!! it's such a relief- I cannot tell you how much this means to me- I've always thought that I'd kill myself before senior year ends, but I think I can actually make it out of here to college!!!!",0

"My BF stood up to my Dad and Mom is FINALLY divorcing him!! *Edit: Wow, This blew up, Thank you all for the wonderful comments, And Thanks for the awards, i wish i could thank everyone who gave me one, but i can't seem to find any messages that tell me who send them, so please don't see me not thanking you personally as me being ungrateful, but if/when i have an update, PLEASE don't spend your money/awards on me, i don't want to tell you what to do with your money, but use the awards on artists or others here on Reddit to help them get a little ""boost"". Thank you!* ❤️ 

My father is the ""classic"" misogynistic, golden child AH.

His parents pretty much worshipped him and ruined him to the point where my Aunts and Uncles have cut him (*and us*) out of their lives, last time i saw them was when my little Sister was born.

He runs his own company, so i think it's pretty save to say that he has never heard the word ""NO"" in his life.

Mom, little Sister (17) and myself (28) are/were essentially his ""servants"".

He'd sit in his chair, drink beer and order us around, Scream and yell at us, Mom was afraid of him, Sis and myself too + we grew up that way and all 3 of us HATED it.

I've begged Mom to divorce him for years but she didn't want to because she didn't want to share custody with him and leave us (and later just Sis) to be treated like crap when we'd have to go to him.

I absolutely understand why she didn't and appreciate her wanting to protect us even if i didn't agree with her method.

That all changed December 24th.

Bf(32) and i have been together for 1.5 years (*roughly*) so this is was our first Christmas where we celebrated together.*Small note on BF, He is not afraid of anyone and HATES disrespect with a passion*.

We walk into my parents house and Dad is in his chair while Mom is working on dinner in the kitchen, Bf goes to Mom to greet her and complimented her on the decorations (*massive smile from Mom*) and he greeted Dad 2nd.

That pissed off Dad but BF has ALWAYS greeted my Mom first unless Dad is significantly closer to him, Dad has complained to me about it because he is ""the man of the house and should be greeted first"" and more BS like that.

But BF has told me that this is how he was raised (*By an amazing woman,* *single Mom of 2, Older sister and him*) and he's not changing anything and i don't see why he should.

BF took an interest in Mom's cooking which smelled AMAZING and i saw Mom light up like i have not seen before, Answering questions, explaining things, sharing tips between them (*he is a really good cook too*), Absolutely lovely to see.

We sat down in the living room, Sis came downstairs and joined us, had a great time together and pretty much ignored Dad who was glued to the TV as per usual.

Mom asked if anyone wanted something to drink and BF jumped up and said ""You've worked hard on the food, It's your time to relax, i'll get it"", he took our ""order"" and went to the kitchen, Dad wanted Beer.

Bf asked him what beer he wanted since there are a lot of different ones in the fridge and dad said (*in an angry tone*) ""Just grab one, i don't care""

Bf comes back with a bottle of wine and 2 glasses for Mom and myself in 1 hand and Sister's drink in the other, Went back into the kitchen to grab the beer and his own drink.

Put the beer on the table infront of dad, Dad stands up and yells ""That's it, i will NOT be disrespected like this in my own house!!!""

Mom, Sis and me just ""shrunk"" but BF turned around and said ""I asked what beer you wanted and you said just grab one, What's the problem?"" Dad: ""It's not about the beer, i got served last in my own house?, You will NOT disrespect me like that!!!""

BF: ""First off, **I** got served last, in fact, i've not even put my drink down, and what did you want me to do? Did you want me to (actually did airquotes) ""disrespect"" your wife or your daughters instead? I have 2 hands, both were full"" and he turned around and sat down.

Dad tried to respond but just stuttered and pretty much ran upstairs, BF continued the conversation like nothing happened until Dad slammed the door and BF said ""Well, That door is shut"", broke the tension and we laughed.

It was like THAT was the moment something changed for Mom

A bit later we sat down for dinner, I went to go get Dad, told him dinner was ready and he snarled ""I'm not coming"", we used to beg him to come down (*not the first time he's pulled this stunt*) but after seeing BF stand up to him, i just said OK and went back down.

We had an amazing dinner with Mom, Bf, Sis and myself.

Afterwards we sat down in the living room for the gifts, Mom went up to get Dad again and came back down not even 30 seconds later and sat on the floor with us to open the gifts.

We had so much fun opening the gifts, Laughing, Drinking, throwing wrapping paper at each other, just having fun without a care in the world (*which i've NEVER seen Mom do*).

Hours later BF and i were heading back home, Mom pulled us both in for a MASSIVE hug (seriously, massive ""Mom hugs"" are something else) and thanked us for ""The best Christmas she has had in YEARS"".

While driving home, Sis texted me a picture of her and Mom, on the floor watching a movie surrounded by a mess which is weird because Mom always had to clean and keep everything ""perfect"" or dad would yell and call her (or us) lazy.

But Mom was ""cleaning it tomorrow"" (HELL YES MOM!!!!).

That all leads to today,

Mom called and asked if her and Sis could come over to discuss something.

They arrived and.....WOW!!!

Mom has had ""simple"" mid back long hair, no color, no ""flavour"", just as simple as possible for as long as i've been alive,

But now, Shoulder length ""bob"" with some ""lowlights"", absolutely STUNNING!!!

All the sadness and fear on her face, GONE, Still Mom, but an absolutely GORGEOUS version of Mom.

She told us that she's going to see a divorce lawyer on the 9th and will try to"" find a place and move out as soon as possible.

After a long discussion on how she wants to do everything, we asked her, why now?

She said (*and i'm proud and so fucking happy she said this*) ""At Christmas something changed for me, To see ""BF's name"" stand up to dad like THAT, And the way BF always treats you, your sister and me with so much love and respect,

BF actually treats me like i'm my own person and i have not felt like that in a long time, With you 2, i'm Mom, Don't get me wrong, i absolutely LOVE being Mom for you 2, but i'm more than just Mom, I was either Mom or Dad's wife (*which is true, he would always introduce her as ""My wife, name"", NEVER ""Name, my wife"", It might not seem like a big deal, but to her it is/was*)

I have not been ""Mom's name"" in a long time, I've had enough, i'm not letting him treat me like this anymore, i'm not in love with him anymore, in fact, i haven't been in love for a very long time, i don't even have love for him anymore.

But Sis is old enough now and with the 2 of you and ""Bf's name"" with me, i can do it"".

I'm so damn proud of my Mom for standing up for herself now,

I'm so damn happy that my BF was able to make her feel like her own person again when he didn't even try.

I'm so damn happy that Mom, Sis and myself NEVER have to be treated like shit by that man again.

I'm just so FUCKING HAPPY!!!!

IF you feel like you're stuck in a similar situation as my Mom, YOU CAN GET OUT, YOU CAN FEEL LIKE YOU AGAIN, DO IT!!!

Find the love for YOURSELF again, whether that is because someone else showed you that you're worth it, because you read my (and Mom's) story or because you found the love for yourself, within yourself again.

YOU CAN DO IT!!! Find YOU again, and BE HAPPY AGAIN!!!

Happy new year everyone!!",0
"A really cute cashier gave me a random compliment. I get compliments a lot but somehow this just stood out to me and I couldn't stop smiling afterI was at Zara and there was this cashier there and he was really handsome at just had that cool, chill vibe to him. At first he was just saying hello, asking me if I needed a bag and all of that in a really neutral normal way, it wasn't like he was already particularly friendly or flirty.

So it kinda caught me off guard when I was already saying thank you when he gave me the change and saying goodbye and he just looked at me and told me I had very beautiful eyes. And that was it, it wasn't like he was asking my number and saying this to charm me, this cute guy just wanted to tell me that he thought I had very beautiful eyes simply because.

And afterwards I just caught myself smiling for a bit every now and then thinking about it. I'm almost kinda disappointed that he didn't ask for my number since he seemed cute, but it still feels really nice to get a respectful compliment like that with no goal behind it and not just guys catcalling or telling you nice things to get your number or to get into your pants.

So yea, thanks to that guy for making my day :)",0

"this title system is weird and and I just want to post about how awesome my partner is.
I came from a horribly abusive household, my mother legitimately wanted me dead. But,

I started dating a guy towards the beginning of this year, and every moment of it has been joy. He helped me gain my freedom from my abusive mom, and is currently helping me learn how to adult in general.

He respects every weird little boundary and oddity I have, he doesn't mind knocking on the door when he comes into our room to let me know he's entering, he doesn't mind when I have days where my skin feels icky and I don't want to be touched(I'm autistic this happens kinda often). He very happily eats the food I cook for him.(I'd say I'm a decent cook)

Every moment of every day feels like I'm living a dream, and it's all because he genuinely wants to see me be happy and grow as a person.

Because of his love and respect, I've had the motivation to take care of myself, I've lost nearly 80lbs (I'm 223lbs now wow!) And I've started eating real food that I am supposed to! (Many dietary restrictions)

Coming up on the new year with him just makes me feel even more excited to finally be free, because I get to live that freedom with him by my side. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️",0

"I'm Almost Finished Reading this Novel And I Love ItSo I'm reading a book called Smoke and Summons by Charlie Holmberg. Its a Fantasy Adventure novel about two characters named Sandis and Rone living life on the run by a mob-group of slavers.

I got finished with chapter 20, I've got maybe 20 percent of the book to go, and I am broken in the best possible way. To sum up whats happening Rone and Sandis are practically homeless and on the  run, and are trying to find a way to escape not only the slavers but also to try and find a better living situation.  Rone's mother is in prison, and he just learned that she's going to be executed in a few days. He learned this from a very rich man who works with the mob, who offered him a ridiculous amount of money and his mother's freedom in exchange for Sandis. 

Sandis is a sweetheart who ran away from the slavers in an attempt to find her long lost uncle, and to hope for a better life. She was initially cold, not knowing how to really interact with anyone, but blossomed to this lovely person who just wants to do the right thing. She doesn't realize it but she fell in love with Rone, and is being more and more vulnerable with him.

Rone has feelings for Sandis too, but has agreed to  turn her in for her mother's safety, freedom, and security for a better life. He's torn apart inside and is hiding it from Sandis and has to deliver her in 2 days to the mob; they practically go on a date together on their last day before Rone turns her in and you can see how much Sandis trusts Rone and loves him and  how broken Rone is over what he's doing and it's all JUST SO DAMN GOOD I COULD FEEL TEARS STARTING TO COME RONE DON""T DO IT

I literally couldn't continue reading it was too heartbreaking after a certain part where Rone is about to deliver her and Sandis could sense the mob and gosh damn I'm just having a great time!

my British friend sent me this belt buckle and letter for Christmas and it just arrived!!,0
"Seven years of searching for a song without words, and tonight I screamed when I found it[reposting due to title length requirements, in case you see a dupe]

So, I used to have a really great playlist of music when Spotify was first getting popular, and I remembered listening to so many of the tracks on repeat together—the playlist was ""night music"" inspired by one evening of my twenties when I realized everyone at a party I was part of had come down from their drugs or substances of choice and/or sexual encounters and/or long stories that traced the room as though they were wisps of hashish smoke. I looked out the window and watched the wind blowing a flashing red traffic light back and forth, and the streets were absolutely still and silent. I was so glad to be alive that moment.

At some point, I deleted the playlist, knowing I'd ""liked"" or favorites all the tracks, and made a much better, larger, more coherent playlist. However, there was this ONE SONG I forgot to like.

This song, mind you, has no lyrics, isn't all that popular or by a big name artist, and even humming the opening tune isn't all that useful because it's a bunch of leaps of fourths and fifths in a piano.

I tried for years to find this. I went through every playlist. I searched message histories. I had Spotify make me playlists based off what I listened to adjacent to it. Over and over. Nada. Until tonight when I was taking a walk through the cold and snow, determined to get ice cream before I fly away from my hometown I visit on Christmases, and I thought I saw a familiar seeming artist name. I gave them a listen, and was like ""oh rad, this is a cool sound they have"" and then a piece of album art struck me, followed by the track's name below it. I had absolutely no memory of any of these until that moment, when I had memory of **all** of this.

And that's how I found the song *Pinch of Peer* by Kettel, and let out a gigantic ""YESSSSSS FUCKING YESSSS HAHAHAhaha"" yell at night in a quiet suburb, and felt like I could roll in the snow with excitement.

Now it's no longer that exciting having listened to it a bunch, but the relief of such a long effort to remember and find it...I swear I still have some sort of aura or afterglow from that moment of total, pure joy.

**Edit**: autocorrect made the song title sound like it was about a tiny bit of citrus zest",0

"First year of marriage has been full of surprises and stress but we feel like we are coming out of the woods!I hope I am posting in the right place but I'm just so happy right now I wanted to tell someone!

My husband and I have been married for about a year. I moved states to be closer to his work and family. We left my house I'd bought in the other state and were long distance tripping to fix it up a couple times a month for the last 8 or so months and it has been completed for the last 2.

We ran into numerous problems with that along the way and recently had to pay a big chunk of change due to my oversight in all of the house buying paperwork and busy-ness. We have been more stressed now than ever before but now that the house is done, everything (that we can possibly think of) is paid and taken care of, we are about to move into our in-laws newly renovated basement for a while while we save up for a home. 

We are so incredibly lucky to be in the position that we are in. My in-laws are nothing short of wonderful and they are such a blessing to me and of course to my husband. 

We will both have about an hour and a half to two hour commute every day into the city and last night we slept at my in-laws and this week are doing a sort of ""trial-run"" with our commute into the city for work. Luckily we both work 9-5 jobs 10 minutes away from each other so it just made sense to take one car. This has been one of the most daunting ideas in moving in with them so we have been sort of putting it off in the name of convenience.

THE CAR RIDE WAS SO MUCH FUN! I know it's still kind of a novelty right now and won't always be as fun as it was this morning but I feel like in so many ways we are coming out of the woods! Luckily, my husband is just a beautiful human being and our problems that we have had in the marriage have all been external but it's been stressful and put a strain on both of us. Transitioning into tackling things together while being newly married has been quite the task but I have always believed I could not have designed a better life partner. 

Once we get established and start saving for a home, we will finally start talking about starting our little family! We both want kids so badly and have just been waiting for the right time and it feels like we are inching up on it. I want to cry I am so happy. 5 or even 3 years ago, I could never have imagined that this is what my life would look like right now and I am overjoyed that our hard work and dedication and investments are beginning to pay off!

I am hugely blessed and just needed to get this out there since I'm new to the area and haven't made any friends that I could tell. I hope everyone is having a beautiful day and a joyous holiday season and end of this year! I love you all! Thank you for listening to my happy rant! :D",0
"Today I put together my first complete bed set that I’ve wanted since I was a kidI grew up super super poor with a big family in a very tiny house. I was the oldest girl so I was expected to help with raising the younger ones, cooking, cleaning, all that crap. We never had our own beds, let alone our own rooms. We would just throw blankets on the floor to sleep. Now, in 2022, I finally reached where I live comfortably financially with a wonderful company and it’s basically my dream job, short of owning my own business. I am able to afford the nice things in life.
I recently moved into a nice apartment which I am totally going to make my own. Today, I put together a bed frame and put my first mattress I’ve ever bought myself, on it. 
I think back and see how far I’ve come and am just so damn proud of myself. I am 38 and I finally have a complete bed set that I got on my own.",0

"I successfully played my first rock song todayI (21f) started playing guitar late august. My inspo is Greta van fleet, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Motley Crue, basically hard rock and blues style rock. Because of my setup I’ve had a hard time getting the rock sound I really want, but I treated myself to a Marshall amp (nearly cried when I first started playing with it) and finally had the sound I was looking for. I finally got to attempt some songs I’d been wanting to play and wow. First song I played was back in black (of course) and started to try black dog. Well today I got the black dog riff and was basically sprinting around my house showing my roommates the video, sent it to my mom, posted it, everything. Then my roommate started to play bass for shout at the devil so we sat down and did it together, which we haven’t successfully done before. It felt incredible. I finally feel like I can embark on the journey of rocking the fuck out. It’s extra special too because I got my guitars from my dad who passed away late June, and I barely evened listened to rock except for when he played it until now.  I know he’s watching me, and I know he’s proud❤️",0

"I confessed my feelings for someone for the first time in my entire life!Hey everyone, hope everyone’s a good day today, I just wanted to share my little ‘love’ story that happened on my recent holiday trip. So I booked a 16 day trip in Europe across 9 countries in early December through Contiki. I went into the trip hoping to meet a lot of new people and see/experience a lot of things in Europe and sure enough I experienced and met a lot of interesting and friendly people that I spent 16 days travelling with. I met this wonderful girl, let’s call her Grace, on the first day of the trip and we sat next to each other on the bus. As we talked and talked throughout the bus trip, I become very fond of her and would spend the next few days of the trip with her, not exclusively but part of a small group. Days went by and I had started to develop feelings for her. Now I’ve never been in a relationship before and I’d say I’m quite inexperienced with the whole flirting ‘game’ because my way of dealing with these kind of feelings is to just ‘sit’ on them or just flat out ignore them. However, I’ve been on a bit of a ‘spiritual’ journey this year with regards to self love and self discovery so I thought what the hell I’ll shoot my shot as I probably have a very low chance of seeing her again after the trip finishes as we all go our seperate ways. So if it happens, it happens. 

Grace had a her birthday coming up soon and we’d be in Rome together to celebrate it so I decided I’ll buy her a thoughtful gift and tell her about my feelings for her but at this point I didn’t know what to get her. About 4 days before we got to Rome, we were in Prague and I was visiting/seeing the infamous Charles Bridge with Grace and a bunch of other people. While we were there Grace kept going on about how the Spider-Man Far from Home had a scene on this bridge featuring Tom Holland and Zendaya. I’m a vivid Spider-Man fan so I knew instantly what scene she was talking about. It was the scene where Tom takes Zendaya out for a walk on the bridge and then tries to give her a gift and confess his feelings for her. This was my light bulb moment, I knew what I wanted to do now. We were going to be in Venice in a couple days and I know in the movie Tom Holland buys a black dahlia flower necklace for Zendaya. So I thought I’d try to kinda replicate that and try to buy the same necklace for Grace.

So a couple days go by and we end up in Venice. At this point I’m so excited because I’ve never done something like this for anyone before and for once in my life I’m actually trying to do something about my feelings for someone. Anyways, straight after the tour of Venice in gondolas, I head out on my search for the necklace on my own. I went into every glass shop I could find as I was walking around the streets of Venice but I couldn’t find exactly what I was looking for. Hours go by and it was soon time to leave the city of Venice yet I couldn’t find anything that I was looking for but thankfully half an hour before we were due to get in the ferry and leave Venice, I found a shop that had a beautiful necklace that had a black flower as the central piece and I knew as soon as I saw it that it was the one. It wasn’t exactly like the one in the movie but it looked similar enough so that she’d know where it was from and the meaning behind it. So I left Venice feeling accomplished!

A day later we’re in Rome, finally the day had come! I was very excited and but also quite nervous as this was in the realm of the unknown for me. I mustered up the courage to ask her to see her alone. We met in the lobby and I suggested that we go for a walk outside. So we went on a walk, I asked how her day was going and what she got up to today as we had a free day in Rome. Soon after that conversation I told her that I got her a birthday gift and promptly handed her the wrapped box with the necklace. As she opened it, she realised what the necklace was and where it was from almost immediately. She stopped walking and asked “Is this a black dahlia necklace?” and I promptly said yes. She opened up her arms and asked me for a big hug. It was one of the best hugs I’ve ever received and then I told her about my feelings for her. She told me she kinda knew already from other people (I told a few other people on the trip) but she wasn’t really looking for anyone at this point as she had a really bad break up earlier in the year. She had also started to distance herself from a bit from me prior to this day but I didn’t really try to think of it much. Anyways I understood her perspective  on the matter and thanked her for her honesty. On the way back to the hotel she told me she felt bad for saying no and I told her that she shouldn’t feel bad about being completely honest with me, it’s for the betterment of both of us. 

We then proceeded to distance ourselves a bit from each other for the rest of the trip to give each other a bit of space. I didn’t let this rejection ruin the rest of the trip. In my mind I wore it like a badge of honour. I‘m so proud of myself that I did something like this for someone special even though it didn’t work out in the end. Now I feel like telling every one of my friends and the whole world about this so here I am! Every now and then I’d watch the Venice and Prague scene from the movie to ‘feel’ the butterflies again because I went out and did something very similar to the movie.

Thanks for reading all this if you got to the end. I appreciate you!",0
"Not my happiness, but yours. My wish is this makes you happy ❤️ you all deserve to be happy.Hello everyone, I don’t often post, but I just wanted to say something to everyone, I wish I could personally talk to each and every single one of you and make it a personal touch but I just don’t have that many hours in the day 😅 

You are beautiful, you are an amazing person with a wonderful soul who is capable of incredible things. Never forget that no matter who you are, where you are, how you feel, there will always be someone out there who loves you, who cares about you and wants you to succeed. 

I am so proud of you for what you’ve accomplished this year, that goal that you’ve been working at for so long, you’ve finally started progress towards it or have even finished it! Take time to reflect on how far you’ve brought yourself and let’s make this next year the best one to date! ❤️ 

I want you all to be happy, you all deserve it. From the bottom of my heart, for the people that needed to hear this, for the people who didn’t need to but felt a little warmer because of it, always remember that feeling, it will carry you through a lot. 

I wish happy holidays and a very happy new year to each and every one of you who reads this. ❤️

"My girlfriend's family made me feel like one of them this ChristmasSo I was spending Christmas Eve with my girlfriend and her family. We eat food, played some Jackbox, and did a tradition called ""Find the Christmas pickle"" which isn't what it sounds like. Her parents hid a pickle ornament in the tree and had us all look for it. Her little sister found it and got a gift card, and everyone else got ""runner up"" gifts. They gave each of us a sharpie coloring set. I excused myself to use the bathroom, and went to ball my eyes out. I didn't expect to get any gifts this year, and even more overwhelming was that I didn't expect to feel loved by anyone but my partners and our close friends. I realized these people had really accepted me as part of their family, and something I didn't realize was partial became whole again. Once I came back from the bathroom they began handing out their ""Family Gifts"" and explained to me that they give gifts from each other on Christmas Eve and get gifts from Santa the next morning. Her mom gave me a look like ""smile and nod for the little kids"" and I did. As they passed out gifts, they gave me a big box. I said ""Who's this for?"" And my girlfriend said ""You, silly."" I cried the second time because they gave me a brand new air fryer, which was such a thoughtful gift for reasons that I won't lengthen the post with. I thanked them profusely and we went on to eat ice cream and watch Elf. It gets crazy from here. I told my girlfriend I'd like to head home soon so we can have some alone time, and before we can leave, her mom asked to pull me aside into another room. She pointed to a huge sack filled with gift-wrapped boxes and said ""Santa dropped off your gifts early so you could take them home."" I immediately knew these were for the small girl within earshot, so I said ""Oh got it, thanks for holding onto them."" Me and my girlfriend got the bag into the car and I said ""I hope your dad helps you get that back inside later. It's heavy."" She looked so confused and said, genuinely, ""Honey, these are yours. We're taking them to your house."" I stared at her for a second, just waiting for to say she was joking, but she didn't. I immediately broke down sobbing in her arms. I really feel like part of the family.",0

"4:30 AM in bed, and I finally feel happy again :)I wrote a million songs about being sad, hoping that one day it’d be my turn to be happy. That day has come!

Yesterday I heard I got accepted in to my dream college I’ve been trying to get in to for 2 years with a lot of ups & downs (mainly downs) 

I FINALLY DID IT!
I got the news a month earlier than expected today, so it really came out of the blue. Now I’m in bed, it’s 4:30 am, and I feel warm & fuzzy all over after lying awake all night. It’s finally dawned on me that the live I’ve wanted to have and fought for will actually happen in a few months. I’m actually crying with happiness. Didn’t even know I could do that.

On top of that, I think I’m starting to develop a crush on this girl I met through mutual friends. I don’t know her all too well, but it feels AWESOME to experience teenage-like butterflies after years of not trusting anyone after my gf of 3,5 years cheated on me, and moved in with, a guy a month before lockdown.

AND I’m seriously getting into working out, and loving every minute of it. I feel healthier than ever, mentally and physically.

Guys, it’s finally my turn to be happy. And for the first time in a long while, I can finally say I’m so incredibly excited for the future. I can’t wait for what’s in store for me!",0

"I just got to give my best friends a gift of a $10,000 education fund for their son and my heart feels warmSo, I had a couple really fortunate things happen to me this year, two very elderly relatives passed away last year(after big happy 94 year lives each), and this year I received estates from both of them. I’ve been able to pay for a DP on a house, and to furnish that house, but my favorite thing I’ve been able to do with this money is to apportion 10k of it to my best friends 9 month old son, in the form of an education and/or QoL fund. Husband came up with the idea, I immediately was on board, and since then we’ve just been waiting for Christmas to tell our friends. 

Finally got to set aside the time to see them, I gave them a cute little plushie I also bought of Isabelle from Animal Crossing, and the card was in the box with her. Both of them were so excited and happy, and it just made me feel so good because they have had a bit of a tough time with money with this baby being a surprise, so I am happy that I can pass forward the generosity that I had given to me, in some small way. 

I won’t remember buying a cool table, or redoing my front deck when I’m 80 and looking back on my life. I will remember hearing my best friend yell “no you’re not, no you’re not!!!!” excitedly, and that’s a better use of my money always.",0
"One year later, I finally feel like I am the woman I want to beIn January, I was at a dead end job, knowingly working less than what I was worth.

It was a rough time and I was really depressed and felt like I had done everything I was told to do, and yet, I wasn’t making it as an adult.

Forward to this December, I live in a big city, I got a new job that pays well over than what I was expecting to earn and it is a very easy and non-toxic work place. Our cat is healthy and happy. And my boyfriend is now my fiancé. 

It’s just crazy how much my life had changed in a year, and how different I feel. I still have my moments, but 2022 has blessed me so much.",0

 This might seem like a small thing if you’re not horsey but it’s huge. It takes a lot for an owner to want to invite someone to take care of their horse. They’re expensive and incredibly fragile animals. I know of the work and effort she’s put into riding over the last year and I’ve seen her on horses and seen how she is with them. I do tell her these things but I’ve been riding longer and I’m an instructor myself. Me being her fiancé, I think she thinks I’m incapable of being honest about her riding sometimes. I see the progress she’s making in a short amount of time and I’m incredibly proud of her for that. I learned as an adult and I took way longer to achieve the knowledge and feel that she has already. She makes me so proud of her! 

 I’m just happy because it’s a mark of her progress. I’m proud because the hard work is paying off. It’s a wonderful opportunity and one that will make our own dreams of having a yard and working together in the industry more achievable too. It’s a huge step in the right direction for her. 

 I’m just very proud of her for standing out enough to get this chance and I’m overjoyed that she gets this experience. She only told me a few hours ago and I’ve been buzzing ever since! <3",0

"Sometimes I use my husband's body wash as bubble bathIt's so cold today (-28F/-33C) so I'm taking a bath right now and drinking some hot coffee to warm my bones. On days like this I really like to use my husband's body wash as a bubble bath. It makes me feel so warm and cozy, being enveloped in his smell 🥰 I can hear him shuffling around downstairs. He said he'd be wrapping my Christmas presents while I was busy so I couldn't peek 🙈 I'm so happy right now. We've been trying since the summer for a baby and this was our last month to try before we have to wait again, so cross your fingers that we were successful 🤞 I should know next week, I'm hoping 2023 is our happiest year ever",0

"Impossible things. Tears came to my eyes two days ago, sitting at my desk as a film played on Amazon, and not in Final cut. A friend once called it my life’s work. The journey was filled with wonder. It never could have happened with out the love and support of everyone in my life, and faith.So many said this was impossible, and like Alice, I fell into the rabbit hole. Often, the words of Lewis Caroll swim through my mind. 

“    Alice laughed. 'There's no use trying,' she said. 'One can't believe impossible things.'

I daresay you haven't had much practice,' said the Queen. 'When I was your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast….   “

Let us all do six impossible things together before breakfast when we awake. Love each other, always, never give up on the things you love, things like helping others and what makes you feel alive, even though the world may think you mad, have faith, be grateful for each day without looking ahead, love yourself, always, there is only one you, and shine.",0

"The love of my life asked me to marry him tonight! After over a decade of what feels like constant bad luck, I finally feel like I get to be happy.I got engaged tonight! I knew he was going to ask soon when my sister who can't keep a secret let slip a while ago that he asked her to go shopping with him for ideas on ""jewelry"" for me. (He picked the wrong sister to ask 😂). 

It was perfect. Chilly weather and Christmas lights, and it was so pretty out. I felt his energy shift before and I could tell he was nervous, because he's normally a pretty confident guy but his voice got so quiet and his tone shifted. 

I just can't believe this is happening for me. I've been in really horrible relationships before him. I have autism and tourettes and my last ex was so abusive that I spent so much time just apologizing for my tics. Sam loves me so much and embraces all of me, even the parts that are difficult to live with. 

I can't wait to be his wife. I've been so nervous about him proposing since I figured out he was going to just for fear that he would get tired of me someday and losing him would be so much more painful than anything. But hearing the wonderful things he said tonight was so reassuring to me; this man really loves me and wants me forever. I finally feel like I get to just be happy.",0

"Rather suddenly and out of nowhere I decided to sponsor a child and it’s already changed my life.We’ve all seen the commercials and other ads. I never really paid attention, and I’m not going to lecture anyone on the topic.

I was watching a show last week and someone mentioned “living a life with meaning”. My life is in no way meaningless - but still, the comment stuck with me, and kept popping back into my head during quiet moments of solitude. I decided to make a difference in someone else’s life… a stranger. I did research for a couple of days, then approached my wife with the idea of sponsoring a child. She was completely on board with the idea, so we went for it.

Being D&D players, we decided to let the dice determine our fate. We rolled dice for the child’s gender: even a boy, odds a girl. We rolled even. We then rolled two 6-sided dice to determine age. We rolled 8. So we’d sponsor an 8 year old boy, but where?

We live in the US, so we decided on Mexico, for a couple of reasons. We decided that if we ever wanted to visit the child in the future, Mexico would be much more realistic for us than going to Africa or Asia. Also, my wife was already learning Spanish, and that could prove very useful.

I’m incredibly excited about this experience! I’ve sent an introductory email to the child we’re sponsoring, with a couple photos of us and our dogs, and can’t wait for our first response.

In the title I said this has already changed my life… here’s one way it has: the child’s family lives on about $70 a month. While we’re by no means rich, that’s mind blowing to me. I’m looking at every purchase differently now. I spent $29 today on a small bag of puppy food. That’s almost two weeks of income for the child’s family. It’s very sobering.

I spent most of today exploring his village on google maps, watching YouTube videos about the region, and reading Wikipedia and other articles. His village is pretty small, but is known for its export. It’s absolutely fascinating, exploring this other culture, and seeing where this kid goes to school, church, and shops.

We’ve pledged the default $39 a month to start, but will probably increase it later. If you don’t have experience with any of this stuff (like I didn’t) that money goes into a pool with the money from other sponsors. That pool of funds is then used to improve the community by providing clean water, food, school supplies, etc.

I’ve learned a lot about how these kinds of programs make a huge impact on these kids (I’ll spare you the numbers), but wasn’t prepared for the impact on myself. I’m thinking about this kid constantly, and it has done something to me deep down to know that I might be having a positive impact on his life that may severely alter his future for the better.

Since I’ve written a book here I’ll stop, but not without saying this experience has me feeling wonderful, and I’ve only just begun this journey! :)",0
"I hosted the first live stand up comedy show at the first outdoor legal cannabis lounge in Oakland, CAHey all, 

I posted in r/happy about a year ago to celebrate my first time being paid to do stand up comedy. 

This last weekend, I was hired to produce and host a comedy show at Blunts N Moore, the first equity ownership dispensary in Oakland. 

To be able to bring two things close to my heart (cannabis and jokes) together in a monumental way makes me feel on top of the world. I cannot tell you how much happiness this brings me. It’s indescribable!

"A dating app helped me find someone I thought I'd lostI'm posting this here because, while I want to shout my happiness from the mountaintops, I'm not ready for my friends and family to find out yet and I'm fairly certain that no one in my personal orbit is on Reddit.

This is going to be a little long-winded, and I'm not sure where to start, so (apologies in advance), I'm going to start in a dark place.

About 6 years ago, I found myself at what turned out to be the tail end of a very unhealthy marriage. I knew something was wrong, but I hadn't connected all the dots yet. I didn't grow up with language that accurately captured abuse in all its forms. Throw in a heavy dose of conservative Christianity  and I was left with a toxic soup of ""if he doesn't beat or cheat,"" there's no escape unless someone dies. Even though it felt uncharitable, I was praying it would be him. Then it occurred to me that I could make it be me, but I had two small kids and leaving them alone with (let's call him) #1 felt cowardly.

There was a ray of light, though, in this dark period. It just so happened that I gained a new colleague that year: the sweetest, most supportive person I have ever met. I was immediately drawn to his soft, gooey center, and it didn't hurt that he was good looking, too. I never let on how I was feeling because, after all, I was married and he was an honorable man. 

Then one day, I had a particularly distressing conversation with #1 while at work. Normally, I would have gone down to see my best friend, K, over my lunch break, but she was in a meeting, so I came running back up the stairs, only to encounter (let's call him) #2. When he asked what was wrong, without even thinking about it, I vomited out all my inner turmoil. Then he said something that caused me to reevaluate everything. He told me that no one should hurt me like #1 was hurting me. I'd never looked at it that way, and that paradigm shift is what ultimately enabled me to gather the courage to walk away from #1. Granted, it took more than a year before I left #1 for good, and another before the divorce was final, but #2's kind words were the push that I needed in the right direction.

I wound up changing careers that summer, and #2 and I fell out of touch. After my divorce was final, though, I called him to thank him for his kindness. We called and texted intermittently for a while, but it was always just a friendly back and forth, smalltalk and the like. The more we talked, the more I fell head-over-heels for him. I hoped that he'd show some kind of interest in being something more than just friends, but when he seemed to get more, rather than less distant, I started a dating profile and hit it off with a really great guy. 

#3 and I dated for about a year before we got engaged. Then one day, a little more than a year ago, #2 asked how things were going and I mentioned how swamped I was with wedding planning. He responded with congratulations and disappointment that it wasn't him. I died inside a little that day. That was the last time we ""spoke"" until about two weeks ago.

#3 and I wound up breaking up, then reconciling, only to break up again just after Halloween. I'm very grateful for my time with #3. I grew a lot, and he helped put back together some of the pieces that #1 had torn apart, but ultimately, it was not a good fit for either of us. The way we broke up stung a lot, and I mentioned to another friend that I was ready to give up on dating all together, but inspired by my friend's example, after that conversation, I decided to revive my dating profile. 

Well, the day after I created my new profile, who popped up as a potential match, but #2! He was using a pseudonym, but I hoped beyond hope it was him. It was! And I was completely honest about how I had felt and still feel about him.

We've gone on two dates now, and are planning to see each other again, soon. I'm trying to keep my expectations in check, but I'm so excited I could burst! I just had to share this with SOMEONE, even if it is anonymous Internet strangers.",0
"Today I won a $100 gift card at work todayToday I won a gift card to a local Steakhouse.

My partner and I have had a tough couple years. Emotionally, tragically, lay-off after lay-offs due to COVID, psychically, and financially.  Everything. 

We just never felt like we ever caught up with life and just could afford to go out for dinner more than two or three times a year. 

After I won the card l walked back to my locker and as I placed it inside, I cried. Tears of happiness that my partner and I can go out for our first fancy nice dinner in 3 years. 

To just relax, dress up and enjoy a wonderful meal that we have worked so hard to get.

Little things like that just made my day. My year. Everything right now",0

"The Blessing Hidden in the Mode of Self-CriticismNever forget that nobody will ever judge you as hard as yourself. We have “negative default modes.”

So you know two things:

- You only have the mere *potential* to see your true worth and capabilities on the absolute best of your days.
- **Just as important**: On every other day, you can be 100% certain that you fail to see what that of which you’re truly capable. 

In other words, on anything but your perfect days you are blessed with the guarantee that you are better than you believe. Think of the best you see in yourself. It is certainly not true, and you are certainly better.",0
"Just welcomed my second daughter into this world and am so damn happyI'm sitting on the couch eating congratulatory chocolates sent over from my neighbor after having my second child. Another girl. Who ever knew I would be the mother of two daughters?

I certainly did not.

Not when I was rocked to sleep with the lullaby of fear. Not when I put on old broken down tennis shoes and taught myself how to run. Not when I shackled myself to the promise of pain, a dopamine rush, an expectation. And became a shell of who I knew I actually was inside.

Still, hope was the thing with feathers. Fluttering, beating. And eventually what was beating, repeating, ""don't give up, don't give up, don't give up"" tried a different tactic. Got tired of me ignoring the rustling in my chest and started tattooing itself instead onto my skin. As I saw it, undeniably there, I tried to grate it off. Shed it. Layer upon layer of rough calloused shame and humiliation. I let go of the defeat that I had superglued to my chest. Realizing that my arms hurt, not because arms are supposed to hurt, but from the weight of it. Realizing that I held up a mirror like a shield, never giving anyone the chance to really see me, the person behind it.

One day started out like every other one. I opened my eyes and took a breath. And then started a new life.

And here I am now. My heart swells like a full barrel that is about to burst with love. I can see the waves outside, thrashing against the shoreline in the icy air. My legs are covered in a blanket, this tiny being resting against me. My partner in the kitchen washing dishes and singing. My toddler upstairs dreaming under the canopy and the mural of stars that we painted together. Stay wild moon child, a sign we hung above it as we sang and danced together. For a minute I close my eyes and live here, no longer drifting along clumsily attempting to moor with whatever I hoped was secure. And I paint the inside of my lids with the life I create.",0

"For the first time, I have someone who truly accommodates for my rare allergyI have a rare allergy called cold urticaria - cold temperatures make me break out in rashes and swelling and it is an extremely uncomfortable condition to live with. I can’t exercise outside, I always have to be warm (heating is expensive) and I can’t walk places during the winter. I can’t eat ice cream without getting itchy and anything cool to the touch, I’m hypersensitive to. After getting a bad reaction I’m ill for hours afterward as allergies take a massive energy toll on the body. A real pain in the ass all-round.

And for the first time in my life, I’m in a healthy relationship. I’ve been through a couple abusive ones that left me pretty messed up but I’ve worked on it and finally have a very loving, very genuine partner who fills me with joy. He’s an artist, a musician, a massive nerd and a fun-fact dispenser. I love him with every bone in my body.

Since getting my allergy 5 years ago, I’ve lived with 99% of the population I come across in disbelief when I tell them I have that rare allergy. Most friends make no attempts to accommodate for it or remember it, and I guess I don’t really expect them to. It (at this point for myself) isn’t “life threatening”, though people with cold urticaria can still get anaphylaxis. It does suck when friends don’t remember that I can’t go ice skating and I need warning if I’m walking somewhere so I can be dressed appropriately, but I brush it off and deal with it as I always have.

My boyfriend on the other hand, I’ve never felt so seen and cared for. He bought me reindeer slippers so my feet won’t get cold on the wood floors, he got rugs to put all over his flat so I won’t have to be cold in the bathroom, at the kitchen sink, etc. He throws me his electric blanket and other fluffy blankets he uses for himself, his snug hoodie-blanket, makes me warm tea. He even lets me use his body to warm my hands and feet on cuz he’s a human radiator.

And when some of his family rolls their eyes and thinks I’m just being dramatic about my condition (such as not being able to walk in icy weather for a family dinner) he gets angry with them and defends me and advocates for me without me even being there. For the first time, I am truly seen. I’m accommodated for, I’m loved and I’m safe. He doesn’t forget that I need extra help and it makes me teary eyed to be so cared for. 

For anyone else out there with disabilities, you can have love just the same. Someone is out there who will accommodate for you and love you for all your body’s quirks. Don’t ever settle for less. You deserve the care.",0
"Finally getting to know my dads side of the family!My mother and father broke up before I was born. He was away in the army and by the time he got out my mother had moved on and had my brother.

I didn’t find out my brothers dad wasn’t my dad until I was around 13/14, we got in contact but didn’t talk much and it was more so his mother trying to talk to me which I wasn’t really interested in at the time as I was a young kid who just wanted to know his real dad. 

I’m 21 now. Last weekend we met up, he took me for lunch and a few pints. Was really honest and opened up about struggling with depression and his mental health after being in the army. We had a good talk, I was happy to finally get to know him. It’s scary how similar he and I look and how much we have in common. 

Recently, I’ve been playing cod with him and my uncle. They’ve promised to take me camping, fishing and hiking come spring time and I even got to talk to my younger brother last night. I have siblings my mother has had but it was so weird hearing this kid be happy to get to know me too and shouting about how I’m his big brother (I understand this must be pretty exciting for him too).

I just wanted to share this with people, I don’t want to overload my mother since I do kinda get the impression she might feel a bit left out since her and I never connected with our interests and she seemed slightly upset that I went to a pub with my dad first for a few pints rather than her (she’s been pregnant and covid has prevented this).",0
"My partner turned my biggest insecurity into a complimentI’m pudgy and I wasn’t always but since Covid I just ate more and worked out less. I have “butterfly wings” on my back, big thighs, and a pouch.

This Easter 9: Myths and Misconceptions,0
Hi! I made a cheerful website during these tough times.,0
"Where joy comes fromJoy doesn't grow well in isolation. The best and most sure path to joy isn't a job or career.  Joy grows much better when we open ourselves up to love.  We need  to be brave enough to endure the possibility of pain and let people love us.  Joy can flourish when we let people know us and see inside our hearts.  

A shared life is far more fulfilling.  It is not a guarantee of joy, but it does seem to be a requirement.",0
"Understanding joyI think that joy is easier to describe than it is to define in a meaningful way. 

Joy is appreciating beauty for its own sake.  Joy is finding hope for the future in the potential of the people you hold dear.  Joy grows out of living a life of gratitude.  

Joy isn't always euphoric. I see joy more as a warm glow inside of you when you cherish your own life and share it with people you love.  

That's what I think joy is.  

God has led me through years of lonely darkness and pain to a place where I am beginning to know joy in my own life.  

My best suggestion is to hold a baby.  That seems to be the shortest distance I have found to joy.",0
"What is Joy?Today I was asked when the last time I felt joy was. I thought for an annoyingly long time. I had to finally answer that I couldn't remember. I'm sure I've felt joy at some point in my life, but every memory that gleens a fleck of joy is tainted with a cross thought. I can't remember a moment of pure joy. Either I don't know what pure joy is, or I've never experienced it.

What is joy?",0

Hi,0
bookmarkeven though we are simply friends. i just feel very happy now. i dont know if it is because it is our 20th shift together over the course of 200+ days but I feel a connection of some sort. leaving single or not i am just glad for this connection and i even updated my look just to match.,0
How I feel joy.The only way I can feel joy is to let my non-priority problems linger forever. This way I actually appreciate everything around me.,0
I really like big breasted broads. Some sort of inner confidence and a subtle sexuality is emitted by them.,0

"A beautiful fate made by an unfortunate series of coincidences.The story of my night light. 

It was a cold winter October last year, and our light was broken in our flat. I go and get this night light, among other things, but when I got home my flatmates already fixed it. Then what made me buy it? When I moved I thought about leaving it behind but they were remodeling but still brought it along because it looked nice. Until one September evening when the garden light went out and me and my new flatmates were in the dark. I decide to bring it out, put batteries and turn it on as a shed light. Then one of my flatmates three year old daughter comes to us and wants to play. I teach her the magic of light. She laughs, tries it, laughs, grabs it and runs and hides it in the house. Her parents couldn't find it. The next day they found it and took it back to her secret hiding spot. A random night light was fated to be the magic treasure of a three year old girl. #myjoy #string of fate #happymoment",0
